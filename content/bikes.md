In finishing up my dissertation and applying to postdocs I was struck by a great deal of fear and dread about how my life was going to change, and so I did whatever I could to not work and not think about the job market. So I started working on vintage road bikes, particularly French ones. It was something of a life saver for me, as working on a bike is a pristine domain of success and failure: if something breaks, its broken, and it needs fixing. If you mess up, the bike lets you know, and the bike never lies.

# Motobecane Mirage

I first started fixing up bikes when a bike mechanic friend found an old Motobecane Mirage in an alley of Hyde Park. He said it was in such a condition that he wouldn't even bother donating it overseas, which I accepted as something of a challenge. Not knowing anything about how to fix bikes, it started me on a journey and obsession that has brought me great joy.

The hardest part was removing and installing a new bottom bracket for this bike. Motobecane, contrary to many other French bike manufacturers, used a unique bottom bracket threading which provokes a great deal of confusion, even among seasoned bicycle mechanics. It took trial and error to find the right size bottom bracket, with the right threading but I did. And it works great.

In the course of fixing up this bike, I actually found the identical make and model (probably year too) and purchased it.
