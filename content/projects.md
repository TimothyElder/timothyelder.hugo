*My work is unified by an interest in how knowledge is organized and mustered to inform the practical work of social institutions like medicine and the academy.*

#### Collaboration and Decision Making In Medical Specialties

Using interview and ethnographic methods my dissertation research explores the relatively new medical sub-specialty of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, which is oriented toward the care of patients with chronic and life-limiting illness. I explore how these kinds of clinicians understand their role as consultants in hospitals and collaborate with their colleagues from other specialties. In particular, I am interested in understanding how physicians working in very different medical specialties are able to create shared criteria of success and failure in the course of providing care for patients suffering terminal illnesses. 

#### Status and Subfield: The Distribution of Sociological Specializations across Departments

{{< customImg src="/images/new_hists.png" width="700px" >}}

The fundamental insights of the Sociology of Science and of Knowledge is that our epistemic endeavors are not solely governed by the ideals of the scientific method. Recognition, personal achievement and career advancement in science is influenced by the individual characteristics of the scholars that produce knowledge. Using the discipline of sociology as a case study, we examine how different subfields are distributed across PhD granting departments in the United States and how the demographic composition of these different subfields influences their relative status.
