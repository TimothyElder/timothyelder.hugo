I'm a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Chicago and I study topics in the sociology of medicine, knowledge, social network analysis and death and dying. My dissertation investigates how physicians create plans of care for their patients: how they navigate conflict and build consensus, how they prognosticate and think about possible futures, and how they do all of this while honoring their obligations to ensure the well-being of their patients and colleagues is maintained.

Besides medicine I am also very interested in the study of the contemporary scientific enterprise. A past project I pursued examined how phenomena are constituted as objects of scientific scrutiny and how scientists created criteria for what are appropriate and inappropriate objects of study.

Lastly and not leastly, I have an enduring interest in philosophy, particularly moral philosophy and the philosophy of science. Lately, I have been particularly interested in questions of value; what makes human life valuable and worthwhile, under what conditions are those not met, and what are the implications on the status of moral agents.

I also have a cat named Bat who is very cute.
