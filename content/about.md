I'm a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Chicago and my research explores how knowledge is organized and used to inform expert work, particularly in the medical and scientific fields. My dissertation is a qualitative study that investigates how physicians and nurses working in Hospice and Palliative Medicine relate to their patients and interdigitate with medical experts from different specialties. In particular, I study how clinicians aid patients with chronic and life-limiting illnesses in making decisions about what kind and how much care they will receive. I am also very interested in supporting the endeavor for a more open science by creating reproducible documents with plain text software.

I also have an enduring interest in philosophy, particularly moral philosophy, philosophy of science, and metaethics. I have been particularly interested in questions of value; what makes human life valuable and worthwhile, under what conditions are those not met, and what are the implications on the status of moral agents.

I also have a cat named Bat who is very cute.
