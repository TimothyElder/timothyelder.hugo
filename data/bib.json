More recent discussions of\n              SDM\n              have highlighted the important of context, both internal and external to the consultation, with a recognition that decisions cannot be understood in isolation. This paper uses conversation analysis (\n              CA\n              ) to examine how decision‐making is enacted in the context of antenatal screening consultations in Hong Kong. Building on previous\n              CA\n              work (Collins\n              et al\n              .\n              \n              , Toerien\n              et al\n              . 2013), we show that, whilst previously identified formats are used here to present the need for a decision, the overriding basis professionals suggest for actually making a decision in this context is the level of worry or concern a pregnant woman holds about potential foetal abnormality. Professionals take an unknowing ‘epistemic stance’ (Heritage\n              \n              ) towards this worry, and hence step back from involvement in decision‐making. We argue that this is linked to the non‐directive ethos that prevails in antenatal screening services, and suggest that more research is needed to understand how the enactment of\n              SDM\n              is affected by wider professional contexts and parameters.",

This review interrogates social imaginaries of the ‘good death’ in the context of current global, health and sociopolitical challenges.\n            \n            \n              Recent findings\n              Research literature and policy documents across fields continue to place emphasis on the ‘good death’. As part of the equity turn in palliative care, there is a growing body of work highlighting the diverse perspectives of people whose voices were heretofore not understood. Inequities are evident not only in terms of who has access to a ‘good death’ but also related to the effects of the dominant ‘good death’ script itself.\n            \n            \n              Summary\n              There is increasing evidence that pursuit of the ‘good death’ narrative may be counter to supporting people as they are living and dying. The authors instead argue for a research, policy and practice shift to ‘matters of care’.",

		"abstract": "Open‐ended personal interviews were conducted with 20 women with early stage breast cancer attending a regional cancer centre in Southwestern Ontario. We explored three related issues: (1) the extent to which these women perceived that they had treatment options; (2) their understanding of treatment benefits and risks; and (3) the role they wanted for themselves and their oncologists in treatment decision‐making.\n            We found, first, that many women who were presented with the choice to undergo some form of adjuvant treatment versus no treatment felt that ‘doing nothing was no choice’. Second, when interpreting probabilistic information on treatment benefits and risks, some women retained the idea of probability but thought that they personally would beat the odds. Others transformed the information to make it more personally meaningful, and still others assessed their risk status by comparing themselves with friends or relatives having the same disease. Third, many women preferred some form of shared treatment decision‐making process with their oncologists. Women perceived treatment decisions as either ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ which raised the issue of blame for a ‘bad’ decision should the cancer return. Implications of these findings for clinical practice and for models of treatment decision‐making are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Communication about palliative care represents one of the most difficult interpersonal aspects of medicine. Delivering the “terminal” diagnosis has traditionally been the focus of research, yet transitions to specialist palliative care are equally critical clinical moments. Here we focus on 20 medical specialists’ strategies for engaging patients around referral to specialist palliative care. Our aim was to develop an understanding of the logics that underpin their communication strategies when negotiating this transition. We draw on qualitative interviews to explore their accounts of deciding whether and when to engage in referral discussions; the role of uncertainty and the need for hope in shaping communication; and their perceptions of how patient biographies might shape their approaches to, and communication about, the end of life. On the basis of our analysis, we argue that communication is embedded in social relations of hope, justice, and uncertainty, as well as being shaped by patient biographies.",

		"abstract": "The shift from life-prolonging and palliative care can be fraught with interpersonal complexities as patients face dilemmas around mortality and the dying process. Nurses can play a central role in managing these moments, often with a focus on promoting and enhancing communication around: the meaning of palliative care, the nature of futility and the dying process more broadly. These sites of nurse–patient communication can be highly charged and pose unique challenges to nurses including how to balance nursing perspectives versus those of other stakeholders including doctors. Here, drawing on interviews with nurses, we explore their accounts of communication about futility and the process of transitioning to palliative care. The interviews reveal nurses’ perspectives on the following: the art of conversing around futility and managing patient resistance, the influence of guilt and individual biographies in shaping communication, the importance of non-verbal and the informal in communication, the impact of conflicting organisational expectations on nurses and the process of learning to effectively communicate. We argue that these transitional moments articulate important, and at times problematic, aspects of contemporary nursing and nurse–medical relations.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              In recent years, increases in medical technologies in the critical care setting have advanced the practice of medicine, enabling patients to live longer while also creating dilemmas for end‐of‐life decision‐making. Clinicians have increasingly been called on to involve patients and family members in decision‐making through a process of shared decision‐making (\n              SDM\n              ), yet less is known about how\n              SDM\n              plays out in the critical care setting and the ways in which clinicians engage in\n              SDM\n              . Using observational data from 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork in two intensive care units and interviews with 33 family members of 25 critically ill patients and 51 clinicians, I explore how clinicians refer to the choices available in medical decision‐making paradoxically as a ‘buffet’ of choice while they simultaneously recognise that such rhetoric is misaligned with complex and emotional decision‐making, often involving pain and suffering. Lastly, this paper considers the role of\n              SDM\n              and the ways in which clinicians push back on the ‘buffet’ rhetoric and engage in practices to guide families in end‐of‐life decision‐making by\n              granting permission\n              for families to make decisions and\n              validating\n              their decisions to decline treatment when there is an opportunity for more treatment.",

Our dataset comprises over 80,000 sociology-related dissertations completed at U.S. universities, as well as data on graduates’ pursuant publications. We analyze different facets of how students specialize—topic choice, focus, novelty, and consistency. To measure specialization types within a consistent methodological frame, we utilize structural topic modeling. These measures capture specialization strategies used at an early career stage. We connect them to a crucial long-term outcome in academia: becoming an advisor. Event-history models reveal that specific topic choices and novel combinations exhibit a positive influence, whereas focused theses make no substantial difference. In particular, theses related to the cultural turn, methods, or race are tied to academic careers that lead to mentorship. Thematic consistency of students’ publication track also has a strong positive effect on the chances of becoming an advisor. Yet, there are diminishing returns to consistency for highly productive scholars, adding important nuance to the well-known imperative of publish or perish in academic careers.",

Using an original data set of employed faculty members in 2015 (\n              N\n              = 1,157), I map the hiring relationships between institutions and analyze the observed network structure. My findings show that institutional prestige is a likely organizing force within this network, reflective of a disproportionate number of faculty coming from a few centralized high‐status institutions, as well as predominantly downward flows in hiring patterns. However, further investigation is needed to understand the role of prestige in Canadian higher education, which has been previously characterized as having a flat social structure. This requires attention toward the interrelationships between institutional prestige, scholarly competence, and department size situated within a segmented academic field in Canada. Overall, this study aims to encourage collective self‐reflection and motivate discourse about status‐based inequalities in our own discipline.\n            \n          , \n            Résumé\n            \n              Cet article examine le marché académique de l'emploi au Canada dans le domaine de la sociologie par l'intermédiaire du réseau d’échange des PhD Au moyen d'un ensemble original de données relatives à l'emploi du corps professoral en 2015 (\n              N\n              = 1,157), je trace la carte des relations d'embauche entre les institutions et j'analyse la structure du réseau que j'ai observé. J'ai découvert que le prestige des institutions constitue vraisemblablement un facteur d'organisation à l'intérieur de ce réseau, reflétant un nombre disproportionné d'enseignants issus d'un nombre restreint d'institutions centralisées de statut élevé, de même qu'un flux majoritairement « descendant » des modèles d'embauche. Une recherche plus poussée sera toutefois nécessaire pour comprendre le rôle du prestige dans l’éducation supérieure au Canada, dont on croyait naguère qu'elle possédait une structure sociale « uniforme ». Nous devrons donc porter une plus grande attention aux rapports réciproques qui unissent prestige institutionnel, compétence en érudition et taille des facultés situées dans un champ académique segmenté au Canada. Dans l'ensemble, cette étude invite à une remise en question collective et cherche à déclencher un débat sur les inégalités fondées sur le statut dans notre propre discipline.",

		"abstract": "Early sociological studies of the American higher education system noted that despite a widespread ideology of egalitarianism, both individuals and departments are highly stratified. Their main findings were that 1) the distribution of Ph.D. departments in any given field tended to cluster at the low end of the prestige hierarchy; 2) a few elite graduate programs graduated the vast majority of all Ph.D.'s awarded in the United States; 3) downward mobility for all but a handful of Ph.D.'s was inevitable; and 4) elite graduate programs protected their prestige through inbreeding. Since those studies there have been few attempts to document changes in the structure of stratification in scientific disciplines in general, and sociology in particular. I use longitudinal data on departments and individual data on recent sociology Ph.D.'s to study changes in the structure of the stratification system in sociology over the past 30 years. My results reflect a mixed picture of change and stability; while the distribution of departmental prestige, the production of Ph.D's, and inbreeding mechanisms have shifted since 1964, the pattern of placement of new Ph.D's in doctorate-granting departments has changed very little.",

However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network—who hires whose graduates as faculty—we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a\n              U.S. News & World Report\n              rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline.

		"abstract": "Background\n              Many healthcare organizations have developed processes for supporting the emotional needs of patients and their families after medical errors or adverse events. However, the clinicians involved in such events may become “second victims” and frequently experience emotional harm that impacts their personal and professional lives. Many “second victims,” particularly physicians, do not receive adequate support by their organizations.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A multidisciplinary team was assembled to create a clinician peer support program (PSP) at a large academic medical center including both adult and pediatric hospitals. A curriculum was developed to train clinicians to provide support to their peers based on research of clinician response to adverse events, utilization of various support resources, and clinician resiliency and ways to enhance natural resilience. Between April 2014 and January 2017, 165 individuals were referred to the program including 68 (41.2%) residents, 17 (10.3%) fellows, 70 (42.4%) faculty members, 6 (3.6%) nurse practitioners/physician assistants, and 4 (2.4%) certified registered nurse anesthetists. An average of 4.8 individuals were referred per month (range = 0–12). Of the 165 clinicians referred, 17 (10.3%) declined follow-up from the program. Individuals receiving support had a median of two interactions (range = 1–10). Among those receiving support from the clinician PSP, 16 (10.8%) required referral to a higher level of support.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              We describe the multiple steps necessary to create a successful PSP focused on physicians and midlevel providers. There is an unmet need to provide support to this group of healthcare providers after medical errors and adverse events.",

		"abstract": "Moral distress is a pervasive phenomenon in healthcare for which there is no straightforward “solution.” Rhetoric surrounding moral distress has shifted over time, with some scholars arguing that moral distress needs to be remedied, resolved, and eradicated, while others recognize that moral distress can have some positive value. The authors of this paper recognize that moral distress has value in its function as a warning sign, signaling the presence of an ethical issue related to patient care that requires deeper exploration, rather than evidencing identification of the “right” course of action. Once the experience of moral distress is identified, steps ought to be taken to clarify the moral issue, and, if possible and reasonable, the patient’s values ought to be prioritized. This paper offers concrete actions steps, drawn from theory, which can be used in clinical practice to provide peer support or to facilitate self-reflection for morally distressed individuals. This approach empowers morally distressed individuals to explore ethical issues, identify concrete steps that can be taken, and mitigate feelings of powerlessness that are often associated with moral-constraint distress. The questions guide individuals and peers to reflect first on the micro-space and then more broadly on the institutional culture, facilitating meso- and macro-reflection and action.",

We collected data on participant experiences with adverse events, their emotional responses, the coping mechanisms used, and their perceptions on available support resources.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The survey was sent to 233 CSVS members yielding 66 responses. The majority (77%) of respondents had experiences with adverse event causing serious patient harm. The most common negative experience following an adverse event included feelings of negativity towards oneself, general distress, and anxiety about potential for future errors. The most common coping mechanism was seeking advice from a mentor or close colleague. Peers (82%) and senior colleagues (59%) were the most preferred sources of support. Most of the respondents would reach out to a mentor if they had 1, but 30% reported no mentor or close colleague for support.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Adverse patient events and near misses have serious negative impact on the lives of Canadian vascular surgeons and trainees. Peers and senior colleagues are the most desired source for support, but this is not universally available. Organized efforts are needed to bring awareness in our vascular surgery community on the ubiquitous nature and detrimental effects of adverse events.",

		"abstract": "Supportive, or palliative, care has moved into medicine's mainstream with well-known and studied benefits but continues to be inadequately utilized in many health care environments particularly intensive care units (ICUs). With diverse patient populations in the various ICU settings, the supportive care team must adapt and mold their goals-of-care discussions and relationship building based on the ICU culture and individuals involved. Despite the differences in disease processes, early supportive care involvement in the ICU provides much needed emotional support and symptom management to patients and families in addition to identifying the patient's goals of care early in the hospital stay. The purpose of this article is to provide a general overview of the history of supportive care and clarify current misperceptions, particularly related to hospice, surrounding the specialty. The types of supportive care consults will be explained and their uses in the various ICU settings, and illustrate the advantage of early involvement to not only patients and families but the medical team as well.",

		"abstract": "This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent.",

		"abstract": "Background. Despite the potential of palliative care (PC) to enhance the quality of life for patients with advanced dementia, there is limited knowledge of its inpatient utilization patterns. This study investigated inpatient PC consultation utilization patterns and evaluated its impact on hospital length of stay (LOS) and medical costs among older patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia who were at a high risk of mortality (ADRD-HRM). Methods. Using the 2016-2019 National Inpatient Sample database, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify individual and hospital characteristics influencing PC consultation utilization. We subsequently performed generalized linear models to estimate LOS (using Poisson distribution) and hospital charges (via log-transformation). Results. Our sample encompassed 965,644 hospital discharges (weighted n = 4,828,219) of patients aged 65 years and above with ADRD-HRM. Among them, 14.6% received inpatient PC. There was a notable uptrend in PC consultation utilization from 13.3% in 2016 to 16.3% in 2019 ( p trend<.001). Factors positively influencing and associated with PC utilization included patients that are older, non-Hispanic White, with higher income, receiving care from teaching hospitals, and facilitated with greater bed capacity (all P < .05). Although patients who received PC were more likely to have 3.0% longer LOS ( P < .001), they had 19.2% lower hospital charges ( P < .001). Conclusions. PC substantially reduced hospital expenditures for older patients with ADRD-HRM, but the prevalence remained low at 14.6% in the study period. Future studies should explore the unmet needs of patients with lower sociodemographic status and those in rural hospitals to further increase their PC consultation utilization.",

		"abstract": "The United States does not have enough doctors. Every year since the 1950s, internationally trained and osteopathic medical graduates have been needed to fill residency positions because there are too few American-trained MDs. These international and osteopathic graduates have similar or better average track records than their American-trained MD counterparts. But they often end up in lower-prestige training programs, while American-trained MDs tend to occupy elite training positions. Some programs are even fully segregated, accepting exclusively U.S. medical graduates or non-U.S. medical graduates, depending on the program's prestige. How do international and osteopathic medical graduates end up so marginalized, and what allows U.S.-trained MDs to remain elite? Doctors' Orders offers a groundbreaking examination of the construction and consequences of status distinctions between physicians before, during, and after residency training. Tania M. Jenkins spent years observing and interviewing American, international, and osteopathic medical residents in two hospitals to reveal the unspoken mechanisms that are taken for granted and that lead to hierarchies among supposed equals. She finds that the United States does not need formal policies to prioritize American-trained MDs. By relying on a system of informal beliefs and practices that equate status with merit and eclipse structural disadvantages, the profession convinces international and osteopathic graduates to participate in a system that subordinates them to American-trained MDs. Offering a rare ethnographic look at the inner workings of an elite profession, Doctors' Orders sheds new light on the formation of informal status hierarchies and their significance for both doctors and patients",

Ironically, when medical institutions combine disciplinary regulations with EBM to produce clinical practice guidelines, the outcomes are antithetical to the aim. Such guidelines fail to increase individual physicians' capacity to judge - as EBM promises - because they externalize judgment while imposing disciplinary control. The Impossible Clinic is the first book to interrogate the history, practice, and the pitfalls of EBM and how it persists due to intersecting relationships between professional medical regulation and liberal governance strategies",

In these networks, two physicians are linked if a patient encounters both of them within a specified time interval, according to the data made available by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We find power law distributions on most state‐level data as well as a core‐periphery structure. On a national and state level, we discover a so‐called small‐world structure as well as a “gravity law” of the type found in some large‐scale economic networks. Some physicians play the role of hubs for interstate referral. Strong correlations between certain network statistics with health care system statistics at both the state and national levels are discovered. The patterns in the referral network evinced using several statistical analyses involving key metrics derived from the network illustrate the potential for using network analysis to provide new insights into the health care system and opportunities or mechanisms for catalyzing improvements.",

		"abstract": "Social network analysis has created a productive framework for the analysis of the histories of patient-physician interactions and physician collaboration. Notable is the construction of networks based on the data of “referral paths” – sequences of patient-specific temporally linked physician visits – in this case, culled from a large set of Medicare claims data in the United States. Network constructions depend on a range of choices regarding the underlying data. In this paper we introduce the use of a five-factor experiment that produces 80 distinct projections of the bipartite patient-physician mixing matrix to a unipartite physician network derived from the referral path data, which is further analyzed at the level of the 2,219 hospitals in the final analytic sample. We summarize the networks of physicians within a given hospital using a range of directed and undirected network features (quantities that summarize structural properties of the network such as its size, density, and reciprocity). The different projections and their underlying factors are evaluated in terms of the heterogeneity of the network features across the hospitals. We also evaluate the projections relative to their ability to improve the predictive accuracy of a model estimating a hospital’s adoption of implantable cardiac defibrillators, a novel cardiac intervention. Because it optimizes the knowledge learned about the overall and interactive effects of the factors, we anticipate that the factorial design setting for network analysis may be useful more generally as a methodological advance in network analysis.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Limited access to specialized palliative care exposes persons with late-stage Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) to burdensome treatment and unnecessary hospitalization and their caregivers to avoidable strain and financial burden. Addressing this unmet need, the purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the ADRD-Palliative Care (ADRD-PC) program.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                The study will use a multisite, RCT design and will be set in five geographically diverse US hospitals. Lead investigators and outcome assessors will be masked. The study will use 1:1 randomization of patient-caregiver dyads, and sites will enroll\n                N\n                 = 424 dyads of hospitalized patients with late-stage ADRD with their family caregivers. Intervention dyads will receive the ADRD-PC program of (1) dementia-specific palliative care, (2) standardized caregiver education, and (3) transitional care. Control dyads will receive publicly available educational material on dementia caregiving. Outcomes will be measured at 30 days (interim) and 60 days post-discharge. The primary outcome will be 60-day hospital transfers, defined as visits to an emergency department or hospitalization ascertained from health record reviews and caregiver interviews (aim 1). Secondary patient-centered outcomes, ascertained from 30- and 60-day health record reviews and caregiver telephone interviews, will be symptom treatment, symptom control, use of community palliative care or hospice, and new nursing home transitions (aim 2). Secondary caregiver-centered outcomes will be communication about prognosis and goals of care, shared decision-making about hospitalization and other treatments, and caregiver distress (aim 3). Analyses will use intention-to-treat, and pre-specified exploratory analyses will examine the effects of sex as a biologic variable and the GDS stage.\n              \n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              The study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention that addresses the extraordinary public health impact of late-stage ADRD and suffering due to symptom distress, burdensome treatments, and caregiver strain. While many caregivers prioritize comfort in late-stage ADRD, shared decision-making is rare. Hospitalization creates an opportunity for dementia-specific palliative care, and the study findings will inform care redesign to advance comprehensive dementia-specific palliative care plus transitional care.\n            \n            \n              Trial registration\n              ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04948866.

		"abstract": "Purpose\n              This paper aims to describe relationships among healthcare professionals in a French public hospital using social network analysis (SNA) and to improve health service quality by strengthening health service management and leadership.\n            \n            \n              Design/methodology/approach\n              \n                This study was based on a questionnaire sent to randomly selected French public hospital professionals and administrators. Network composition measures were obtained using a name generator. Analysis focused on three main indicators: “centrality”, “prestige”, and “clique participants”. The SNA was carried out using UCINET\n                ®\n                and statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 15.0.\n              \n            \n            \n              Findings\n              \n                A total of 104 questionnaires were returned and analysed. Centrality, prestige and clique indicators were highly correlated (all\n                p\n                ‐value were less than 0.01). Physicians had the highest scores for the three indicators. Older age (≥45 years) was associated with higher centrality and clique numbers scores. Transversal activity was associated with higher scores than other specific activities (hospitalisation, ambulatory care), except for emergency care.\n              \n            \n            \n              Originality/value\n              The paper shows how networks and SNA techniques provide novel and useful means to understand communication and collaboration between hospital professionals.",

		"abstract": "Background. \n              The rapid expansion in day surgery has facilitated a shift in surgical nursing intervention. The evolving evidence base has a major part to play in influencing nurse‐led preassessment, information provision, pain management and postoperative intervention. However, the literature is characterised by a number of deficits: poor attention to patient experience from admission to discharge, anxieties evoked and the potential needs of patients are not well articulated.\n            \n            \n              Aim. \n              The purpose of this paper is to describe and interpret patients’ experiences of contemporary day surgery.\n            \n            \n              Method. \n              This hermeneutic phenomenological approach focused on the experience of 20 adult patients. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews. The transcripts were interpreted through the identification of four prevalent themes using the phenomenological method.\n            \n            \n              Findings. \n              The themes that emerged from the data are emphasised, ranging from the feeling of empowerment during preparation, through apprehensions encountered and the feeling of abandonment in the preoperative waiting area, to recovery dynamics.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion. \n              The study demonstrates that the majority of the patients felt abandoned in the preoperative stage and nurses did not recognise the importance of ongoing psychological support. Therefore, it is crucial to strengthen the provision of emotional support and person‐centred care in a day surgery context. There is also a need to be aware that environmental factors can impact on patient anxiety, promoting the use of music preoperatively can reduce anxiety and increase well‐being.\n            \n            \n              Relevance for clinical practice. \n              Crucially health professionals need to facilitate person‐centred and continuity of care throughout the day surgery experience. Using dynamic interpersonal skills, such as active listening ‘holding’‘containment’ and attunement to reduce anxiety and feelings of abandonment in the preoperative period. Moreover, being alert to verbal utterances, para‐language and non‐verbal cues demonstrated by the patient. Specific information about delays regarding the timing of procedures needs to be carefully explained.",

The practice of HPM is distinct from their colleagues in other areas because of this unique patient population and the interventions they use. Considering that they are commonly treating patients who are likely to be considered failures of medical intervention by their colleagues, how do these clinicians understand how they have done a good job? In this paper, I explore the unique strategies used by clinicians in HPM to promote success and avoid failure. Rather than longevity or cure, HPM clinicians define good practice as the coordination of all clinical stakeholders (patients, family and colleagues) to a shared goal which they construct from the achievable medical outcomes and the stated preferences of patients.",

		"abstract": "Why are elite jewelers reluctant to sell turquoise, despite strong demand? Why did leading investment bankers shun junk bonds for years, despite potential profits?Status Signalsis the first major sociological examination of how concerns about status affect market competition. Starting from the basic premise that status pervades the ties producers form in the marketplace, Joel Podolny shows how anxieties about status influence whom a producer does (or does not) accept as a partner, the price a producer can charge, the ease with which a producer enters a market, how the producer's inventions are received, and, ultimately, the market segments the producer can (and should) enter. To achieve desired status, firms must offer more than strong past performance and product quality–they must also send out and manage social and cultural signals.Through detailed analyses of market competition across a broad array of industries–including investment banking, wine, semiconductors, shipping, and venture capital–Podolny demonstrates the pervasive impact of status. Along the way, he shows how corporate strategists, tempted by the profits of a market that would negatively affect their status, consider not only whether to enter the market but also whether they can alter the public's perception of the market. Podolny also examines the different ways in which a firm can have status. Wal-Mart, for example, has low status among the rich as a place to shop, but high status among the rich as a place to invest.Status Signalsprovides a systematic understanding of market dynamics that have–until now–not been fully appreciated.",

		"abstract": "Significance\n            Scientific peer review has been a cornerstone of the scientific method since the 1600s. Debate continues regarding the merits of single-blind review, in which anonymous reviewers know the authors of a paper and their affiliations, compared with double-blind review, in which this information is hidden. We present an experimental study of this question. In computer science, research often appears first or exclusively in peer-reviewed conferences rather than journals. Our study considers full-length submissions to the highly selective 2017 Web Search and Data Mining conference (15.6% acceptance rate). Each submission is simultaneously scored by two single-blind and two double-blind reviewers. Our analysis shows that single-blind reviewing confers a significant advantage to papers with famous authors and authors from high-prestige institutions.\n          , \n            Peer review may be “single-blind,” in which reviewers are aware of the names and affiliations of paper authors, or “double-blind,” in which this information is hidden. Noting that computer science research often appears first or exclusively in peer-reviewed conferences rather than journals, we study these two reviewing models in the context of the 10th Association for Computing Machinery International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, a highly selective venue (15.6% acceptance rate) in which expert committee members review full-length submissions for acceptance. We present a controlled experiment in which four committee members review each paper. Two of these four reviewers are drawn from a pool of committee members with access to author information; the other two are drawn from a disjoint pool without such access. This information asymmetry persists through the process of bidding for papers, reviewing papers, and entering scores. Reviewers in the single-blind condition typically bid for 22% fewer papers and preferentially bid for papers from top universities and companies. Once papers are allocated to reviewers, single-blind reviewers are significantly more likely than their double-blind counterparts to recommend for acceptance papers from famous authors, top universities, and top companies. The estimated odds multipliers are tangible, at 1.63, 1.58, and 2.10, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Publishing in top journals is crucial to academic careers, but many fields show substantial ethnic disparities in publication counts, which may be caused by disparities in producing manuscripts or getting them accepted. Here, we investigate the latter mechanism using the peer review files of 16.5K manuscripts submitted between 2013-2018 to a field-leading biology journal (Journal A) and a middle-tier journal of similar scope (Journal B). The editorial data are supplemented with authors’ name-inferred ethnicities and extensive controls including submissions’ topic, author prestige, and citation impact, even for rejected-and-published-elsewhere submissions. We find substantial disparities in acceptance across inferred ethnicities and that these are driven by the editors and not peer reviewers. In particular, for a given amount of future impact and other submission characteristics, papers by East Asian-named authors were 4.3-14.6 percentage points less likely to be accepted than those by British-origin-named authors. Journal A editors were about 7.1-8.1 percentage points less likely to send East Asian-authored (Chinese and non-Chinese) papers out for peer review and, for a given level of reviewer enthusiasm, 7.2 percentage points less likely to ultimately accept them (non-Chinese only). In contrast, peer reviewers gave recommendations that were similar across all name-inferred ethnicities. As science continues to globalize, these findings signal the need to better understand ethnic disparities in the review process.",

		"abstract": "Media outlets play a key role in spreading scientific knowledge to the general public and raising the profile of researchers among their peers. Yet journalists' choices of which researchers to feature are poorly understood. We use a comprehensive dataset of 223,587 news stories from 288 U.S. outlets covering 100,486 research papers across all areas of science to investigate the rates at which scientists are mentioned in the stories about their work as a function of their perceived ethnicity from names. By focusing only on research papers news outlets chose to cover, the analysis reduces concerns that differences in mentions rates are driven by differences in research quality or newsworthiness. We find substantial disparities in mention rates across names associated with particular ethnicities. Researchers with names not from British origins, especially those with East Asian and African names, are significantly less likely to be mentioned in stories of their own research than those with British-origin names, even when controlling for stories of a particular news outlet covering a particular scientific venue on a particular research topic. The disparities are explained only in part by authors' locations, suggesting that pragmatic factors such as difficulties in scheduling interviews play a partial role. We also find that English speaking fluency may be one of the causes because there are disparities in quotation rates among authors affiliated with U.S. institutions. Furthermore, among U.S.-based authors, journalists more often use authors' institutions instead of names when referring to non-British-named authors, suggesting that journalists' rhetorical choices are also key. Overall, multiple mechanisms generate substantial disparities across perceived ethnicities in how researchers are covered in their media attention, and these disparities have likely affected thousands of scholars.",

		"abstract": "Peer review is a well-established cornerstone of the scientific process, yet it is not immune to biases like status bias, which we explore in this paper. Merton described this bias as prominent researchers getting disproportionately great credit for their contribution, while relatively unknown researchers get disproportionately little credit [R. K. Merton,\n              Science\n              159, 56–63 (1968)]. We measured the extent of this bias in the peer-review process through a preregistered field experiment. We invited more than 3,300 researchers to review a finance research paper jointly written by a prominent author (a Nobel laureate) and by a relatively unknown author (an early career research associate), varying whether reviewers saw the prominent author’s name, an anonymized version of the paper, or the less-well-known author’s name. We found strong evidence for the status bias: More of the invited researchers accepted to review the paper when the prominent name was shown, and while only 23% recommended “reject” when the prominent researcher was the only author shown, 48% did so when the paper was anonymized, and 65% did when the little-known author was the only author shown. Our findings complement and extend earlier results on double-anonymized vs. single-anonymized review [R. Blank,\n              Am. Econ. Rev.\n              81, 1041–1067 (1991); M. A. Ucci, F. D’Antonio, V. Berghella,\n              Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. MFM\n              4, 100645 (2022)].",

We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline's ability to fix the world's problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists' objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists' practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.",

Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts\n              et al.\n              describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue\n              10.1126/science.aac4716\n            \n          , \n            A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.\n          , \n            \n              INTRODUCTION\n              Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              \n                We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and\n                P\n                values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (\n                M\n                r\n                = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (\n                M\n                r\n                = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (\n                P\n                < .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.\n              \n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              \n                No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original\n                P\n                value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.\n              \n              Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.\n              \n                \n                  Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).\n                  Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects.

		"abstract": "An academic scientist’s professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive—getting it right—competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive—getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.",

		"abstract": "Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.",

		"abstract": "It has become commonplace to say that contemporary western society is ’deathdenying‘. This characterization, which sociologists have termed the ’denial of death thesis‘, first arose in the social science, psychological and clinical medical literature in the period between 1955 and 1985. During the same time period, the hospice and palliative care movements were developing and in part directed themselves against the perceived cultural denial of death in western society. While the denial of death has been taken for granted by the lay public as well as by clinicians, in the sociological literature it has been increasingly questioned. In this paper we use sociological critiques of the denial of death thesis to raise critical questions about the theory and practice of contemporary palliative care. In particular, we argue that the emphasis of palliative care should not be on extinguishing the denial of death but on the relief of suffering. Palliative Medicine 2004; 18: 121-128",

The contention is that corporatization is transforming the practice of medicine, divesting physicians of control over many features of their work, consistent with the needs of advanced capitalism. I examine the hypothesis skeptically, differentiating between the cultural role of medicine, the political and social legitimacy of medical concepts, and the personal autonomy of the individual physician. I suggest that while physicians are less autonomous than they used to be, the constraints imposed on them fall within a medical paradigm. From a cultural or social perspective, medicine is more central to the economy and more powerful than ever before. As its centrality and importance increase, there is more at stake, and interests compete more aggressively. I conclude that there is little evidence in support of the hypothesis.",

To understand the problematic nature of knowledge and the boundaries that result, an ethnographic study was used to understand how knowledge is structured differently across the four primary functions that are dependent on each other in the creation and production of a high-volume product. A pragmatic view of 'knowledge in practice' is developed, describing knowledge as localized, embedded, and invested within a function and how, when working across functions, consequences often arise that generate problematic knowledge boundaries. The use of a boundary object is then described as a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge to resolve the consequences that exist at a given boundary. Finally, this pragmatic view of knowledge and boundaries is proposed as a framework to revisit the differentiation and integration of knowledge.",

We investigated the effect of early versus delayed PC on quality of life (QOL), symptom impact, mood, 1-year survival, and resource use.\n            \n            \n              Patients and Methods\n              Between October 2010 and March 2013, 207 patients with advanced cancer at a National Cancer Institute cancer center, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and community outreach clinics were randomly assigned to receive an in-person PC consultation, structured PC telehealth nurse coaching sessions (once per week for six sessions), and monthly follow-up either early after enrollment or 3 months later. Outcomes were QOL, symptom impact, mood, 1-year survival, and resource use (hospital/intensive care unit days, emergency room visits, chemotherapy in last 14 days, and death location).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Overall patient-reported outcomes were not statistically significant after enrollment (QOL, P = .34; symptom impact, P = .09; mood, P = .33) or before death (QOL, P = .73; symptom impact, P = .30; mood, P = .82). Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival rates were 63% in the early group and 48% in the delayed group (difference, 15%; P = .038). Relative rates of early to delayed decedents' resource use were similar for hospital days (0.73; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.27; P = .26), intensive care unit days (0.68; 95% CI, 0.23 to 2.02; P = .49), emergency room visits (0.73; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.19; P = .21), chemotherapy in last 14 days (1.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 6.7; P = .27), and home death (27 [54%] v 28 [47%]; P = .60).\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Early-entry participants' patient-reported outcomes and resource use were not statistically different; however, their survival 1-year after enrollment was improved compared with those who began 3 months later. Understanding the complex mechanisms whereby PC may improve survival remains an important research priority.",

Patients who were assigned to the intervention met with a PC clinician at least once per month until death, whereas those who received usual care consulted a PC clinician upon request. The primary end point was change in quality of life (QOL) from baseline to week 12, per scoring by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scale. Secondary end points included change in QOL from baseline to week 24, change in depression per the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and differences in end-of-life communication.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Intervention patients ( v usual care) reported greater improvement in QOL from baseline to week 24 (1.59 v −3.40; P = .010) but not week 12 (0.39 v −1.13; P = .339). Intervention patients also reported lower depression at week 24, controlling for baseline scores (adjusted mean difference, −1.17; 95% CI, −2.33 to −0.01; P = .048). Intervention effects varied by cancer type, such that intervention patients with lung cancer reported improvements in QOL and depression at 12 and 24 weeks, whereas usual care patients with lung cancer reported deterioration. Patients with GI cancers in both study groups reported improvements in QOL and mood by week 12. Intervention patients versus usual care patients were more likely to discuss their wishes with their oncologist if they were dying (30.2% v 14.5%; P = .004).\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              For patients with newly diagnosed incurable cancers, early integrated PC improved QOL and other salient outcomes, with differential effects by cancer type. Early integrated PC may be most effective if targeted to the specific needs of each patient population.",

		"abstract": "Background:\n              There is inconsistent evidence that palliative care intervention decreases total healthcare expenditure at end-of-life for oncology patients. This inconsistent evidence may result from small sample sizes at single institution studies and disparate characterization of costs across studies. Comprehensive studies in population-based datasets are needed to fully understand the impact of palliative care on total healthcare costs. This study analyzed the impact of palliative care on total healthcare costs in a nationally representative sample of advanced cancer patients.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              We conducted a matched cohort study among Medicare patients with metastatic lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. We matched patients who received a palliative care consultation to similar patients who did not receive a palliative care consultation on factors related to both the receipt of palliative care and end of life costs. We compared direct costs between matched patients to determine the per-patient economic impact of a palliative care consultation.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Patients who received a palliative care consultation experienced an average per patient cost of $5,834 compared to $7,784 for usual care patients (25% decrease; p < 0.0001). Palliative care consultation within 7 days of death decreased healthcare costs by $451, while palliative care consultation more than 4 weeks from death decreased costs by $4,643.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              This study demonstrates that palliative care has the capacity to substantially reduce healthcare expenditure among advanced cancer patients. Earlier palliative care consultation results in greater cost reductions than consultation in the last week of life.",

		"abstract": "This study investigates the extent to and mechanisms through which Matthew effects create persistent status hierarchies. We propose a model that highlights the role of cumulative status bias in the feedback loop that leads from initial status allocation to status confirmation. We investigate the formalized process of repeated status allocation in annual elections to the National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star game. Using detailed records on player performances allows us to isolate the Matthew effect from actual productivity differences to show that a previous All-Star nomination improves the chances to be re-nominated. We demonstrate that this Matthew effect is partly explained by improved productivity after an All-Star nomination, but voters’ evaluations are also directly biased by a player’s prior status. Multiple previous nominations further improve a player’s chances, confirming the importance of cumulative status bias. The resulting status-biased persistence of achieved status implies ever greater decoupling of productivity and status, undermining the meritocratic allocation of status and resources even more than the existing literature acknowledges.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Social interactions among humans create complex networks and – despite a recent increase of online communication – the interactions mediated through physical proximity remain a fundamental way for people to connect. A common way to quantify the nature of the links between individuals is to consider repeated interactions: frequently occurring interactions indicate strong ties, such as friendships, while ties with low weights can indicate random encounters. Here we focus on a different dimension: rather than the strength of links, we study physical distance between individuals when a link is activated. The findings presented here are based on a dataset of proximity events in a population of approximately 500 individuals. To quantify the impact of the physical proximity on the dynamic network, we use a simulated epidemic spreading processes in two distinct networks of physical proximity. We consider the network of\n              short\n              -\n              range\n              interactions defined as\n              d\n               \n              \n                \n                  $${\\boldsymbol{\\lesssim }}$$\n                  \n                    ≲\n                  \n                \n              \n               1 meter, and the\n              long\n              -\n              range\n              which includes all interactions\n              d\n               \n              \n                \n                  $${\\boldsymbol{\\lesssim }}$$\n                  \n                    ≲\n                  \n                \n              \n               10 meters. Since these two networks arise from the same set of underlying behavioral data, we are able to quantitatively measure how the specific definition of the proximity network – short-range versus long-range – impacts the resulting network structure as well as spreading dynamics in epidemic simulations. We find that the short-range network – consistent with the literature – is characterized by densely-connected neighborhoods bridged by weak ties. More surprisingly, however, we show that spreading in the long-range network is quite different, mainly shaped by spurious interactions.",

Composed of six bar charts, each graph in the figure provides data for a particular population at the intersection of race and gender, focusing on black, white, and Hispanic men and women. Each graph also has a comparative backdrop of the data on police stops for black males. All graphs take a similar parabolic shape, showing that across each race-gender group, pedestrian stops increase in adolescence and peek in young adulthood, then taper off across the adult life course. However, the heights of these parabolic representations are vastly different. There are clear disparities in police exposure based on race and gender, with black men and women being more likely than their peers to be policed and with black men being policed significantly more than their female counterparts.",

Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences ( rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.",

		"abstract": "Taking a sociological view, we can investigate the empirical consequences of variations in the rhetoric of sociological methodology. The standards advocated in Qualitative Literacy divide communities of qualitative researchers, as they are not explicitly connected to an understanding of social ontology, unlike previous qualitative methodologies; they continue the long-growing segregation of the rhetorical worlds of qualitative and quantitative research methodology; and they draw attention to the personal competencies of the researcher. I compare a rhetoric of qualitative methodology that: derives evaluation criteria from perspectives on social ontology that have been developing progressively since the early twentieth century; applies the discipline-wide evaluation criteria of reactivity, reliability, representativeness, and replicability; and asks evaluators to focus on the adequacy of the textual depiction of research subjects.",

		"abstract": "Many social science studies are based on coded in-depth semistructured interview transcripts. But researchers rarely report or discuss coding reliability in this work. Nor is there much literature on the subject for this type of data. This article presents a procedure for developing coding schemes for such data. It involves standardizing the units of text on which coders work and then improving the coding scheme’s discriminant capability (i.e., reducing coding errors) to an acceptable point as indicated by measures of either intercoder reliability or intercoder agreement. This approach is especially useful for situations where a single knowledgeable coder will code all the transcripts once the coding scheme has been established. This approach can also be used with other types of qualitative data and in other circumstances.",

The authors begin with the contradiction between the assumption of science that interview participants be strangers, on one hand, and the need for rapport in order to establish validity on the other. The authors construct a typology of the social relations in intensive interviewing: (1) the stranger dyad, in which unfamiliarity is assumed; (2) the web of relevance, in which interview participants know of one another at least indirectly; and (3) the web of group affiliation, in which participants are members of a primary group. For each type, different consequences of departures from strangeness for rapport and validity are explored. The authors conclude that although intensive interviews do produce valid data, the effects of familiarity appear problematic more often than not.",

		"abstract": "Qualitative coding procedures emanating from grounded theory were limited by technologies of the 1960s: colored pens, scissors, and index cards. Today, electronic documents can be flexibly stored, retrieved, and cross-referenced using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software. We argue the oft-cited grounded theory framework poorly fits many features of contemporary sociological interview studies, including large samples, coding by teams, and mixed-method analysis. The grounded theory approach also hampers transparency and does not facilitate reanalysis or secondary analysis of interview data. We begin by summarizing grounded theory’s assumptions about coding and analysis. We then analyze published articles from American Sociological Association flagship journals, demonstrating that current conventions for semistructured interview studies depart from the grounded theory framework. Based on experience analyzing interview data, we suggest steps in data organization and analysis to better utilize QDA technology. Our goal is to support rigorous, transparent, and flexible analysis of in-depth interview data. We end by discussing strengths and limitations of our twenty-first-century approach.",

We ask three questions: What specific challenges are at play? How have researchers addressed them? And how should those strategies be evaluated? We argue that such research faces at least five challenges— deception, recall error, reasonableness bias, intentionality bias, and single-motive bias—that more than a dozen strategies have been deployed to address them; that the strategies have been external, internal, or interactional in nature; and that each class of strategies demands distinct evaluation criteria. Researchers will likely fail to uncover motivation if they ignore the possibility of each challenge, conflate one challenge with another, or deploy strategies unmatched to the challenge at hand. Our work helps systematize the evaluation of interview-based studies of motivated action and strengthen the scientific foundations of in-depth interview research.",

Interviews were conducted with four subsamples of young adults: single male university undergraduates (n = 432), single female undergraduates (429), single male nonstudents (220), and single female nonstudents (293). The results indicate that none of the variations had any substantial effect on reported sexual behavior. These findings are consistent with other analyses in suggesting that such methodological variations are not a major source of differential responses in surveys.",

It draws upon a content analysis of clinical research and 25 interviews with cardiologists who must decide whether to use a computer mouse- and algorithm-driven technology and whose status is partially based on manual dexterity – “good hands”. The content analysis shows that researchers do not study topics that reflect the occupation's interest in the technology's capability to strengthen the occupation's standing in competing with other professions for a jurisdiction. The interviews show that the physicians made decisions based on the habits and routines they developed in their training venue, and their subsequent division of labor with colleagues in their current workplace venue. A typology of decision processes is proposed, suggesting the usefulness of capturing foreground preoccupations and the background conditions affecting the physicians' situations.",

Lewontin offered a mathematical heuristic describing the coupling of niche construction and adaptive evolution. Here, we propose a “dual landscape” model to view these relationships. Our model represents change as simultaneous movement on two landscapes, each a function of phenotype and environment. This model clarifies the evolutionary feedback generated by niche construction. We relate our model to Lewontin’s niche construction equations and illustrate it with three examples.",

		"abstract": "Even with widespread interest, public perceptions of science remain understudied and poorly theorized by social scientists. A central issue has been the persistent assumption that publics require a base of scientific knowledge for science to have broad cultural meaning. Yet, recent advances in cultural and cognitive sociology point to alternative research programs seeking to identify how publics come to understand complex and uncertain issues, when information is incomplete and asymmetric. We use this approach to analyze data on public perceptions of how scientific different fields are from the 2006 and 2012 National Science Foundation’s Science and Technology Survey. Our multivariate analyses allow us to approximate how mass publics map the social space of scientific professions, while accounting for individuals’ social location and cultural identity (e.g., race, class, gender, age, scientific sophistication, and political ideology). We then focus our attention on public perceptions of sociology and economics. Overall, we find that public perceptions, rather than being disorganized, map onto recognizable dimensions indicating how publics distinguish between scientific professions.",

		"abstract": "This article demonstrates the value of Foucault's conception of discipline for understanding organizational responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault's depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to buffer or hide some activities. Members' tendency to internalize these pressures, to become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that rankings produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a crucial task for scholars.",

The rise of the entrepreneurial university and academic capitalism are superimposing themselves on the competition of scientists for progress of knowledge and recognition by the scientific community. The result is a sharpening institutional stratification of the field. This stratification is produced and continuously reproduced by the intensified struggle for funds with the shrinking of block grants and the growing significance of competitive funding, as well as the increasing impact of international and national rankings on academic research and teaching. The increased allocation of funds on the basis of performance leads to overinvestment of resources at the small top and underinvestment for the broad mass of universities in the middle and lower ranks. There is a curvilinear inverted u-shaped relationship of investments and returns in terms of knowledge production. Paradoxically, the intrusion of the economic logic and measures of managerial controlling into the academic field imply increasing inefficiency in the allocation of resources to universities. The top institutions suffer from overinvestment, the rank-and-file institutions from underinvestment. The economic inefficiency is accompanied by a shrinking potential for renewal and open knowledge evolution\"--",

		"abstract": "Conversation is incrementally, progressively produced, subject to constraints that ensure linearity (one person speaks at a time) irrespective of the identities, motives, and conversational resources of those present. And yet conversation is also receptive to influence from—or permeation by—external factors, such as attributes, formal status, and relationships. This review summarizes conversation-analytic work on how talk-in-interaction is produced and then evaluates quantitative research on permeation in terms of the realism of its assumptions. Research on rates is found particularly wanting, although the robustness of its results presents a challenge to the claim that the meaning of an action is inextricably tied to its local-sequential context. More theoretically adequate are modeling approaches that focus on transitions, sequences, and the local determinants of discrete events. However, these also frequently make unwarranted assumptions, such as that we can generalize from people who speak to those who do not or that what someone does upon speaking can be considered separately from who speaks in the first place. A solution to the second problem is to model who gets recruited from the ranks of all potential speakers to perform a particular conversational action. The review concludes with directions for future research.",

		"abstract": "This article hypothesizes that minority groups are more likely to protect persecuted groups during episodes of mass killing. The author builds a geocoded dataset of Jewish evasion and church communities in the Netherlands during the Holocaust to test this hypothesis. Spatial regression models of 93 percent of all Dutch Jews demonstrate a robust and positive correlation between the proximity to minority churches and evasion. While proximity to Catholic churches increased evasion in dominantly Protestant regions, proximity to Protestant churches had the same effect in Catholic parts of the country. Municipality level fixed effects and the concentric dispersion of Catholicism from missionary hotbed Delft are exploited to disentangle the effect of religious minority groups from local level tolerance and other omitted variables. This suggests that it is the local configuration of civil society that produces collective networks of assistance to threatened neighbors.",

However, opportunities to transition into such roles are not equal, and underrepresented groups face challenges building and sustaining their representation in the professoriate. What are social resources enabling them to overcome these challenges? To study this, the authors analyze nearly all PhD recipients in the United States from 1980 to 2015 (~1.03 million) and follow their careers. Women and underrepresented minorities are less likely to transition into academia than men and whites, but their chances increase when they are paired with same-attribute advisors and when they have significant group representation in their departments. In contrast, men and white scholars receive no costs or benefits from different- or same-attribute advisors. These findings warrant inspection to see how such relations can be fostered in all mentors.",

The discounting of minorities’ innovations may partly explain their underrepresentation in influential positions of academia.\n          , \n            Prior work finds a diversity paradox: Diversity breeds innovation, yet underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ∼1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.",

What are the characteristics of the specialties, or of the lawyers who practice in them, that might account for these variations in prestige? In describing the prestige differences and several of the variables that might be thought to account for them, the authors analyze the results of a survey of a large random sample of Chicago lawyers. Among the findings are a strong relationship between prestige within the legal profession and the type of clients that the specialty serves, a substantial correlation between prestige and the degree of intellectual challenge presented by the subject matter of the specialty, and the perhaps surprising result that prestige is not significantly associated with the income earned by lawyers practicing in the specialty. The authors conclude that legal specialties that regularly confront personal suffering lose social standing as a result, that prestige within the profession is directly proportional to the degree to which the specialty facilitates the conduct of corporate enterprise, and that the varying prestige of the specialties is likely to affect the political and professional power of the lawyers who practice in them and to influence the patterns of recruitment of lawyers into law practice.",

		"abstract": "Sociological studies of professions have traditionally focused on definitional list-making in an attempt to differentiate professions from nonprofessions. Despite recent criticisms of that approach, it has persisted. After first discussing inconsistencies and difficulties associated with the traditional approach, this paper explores an alternative perspective for analyzing professions. It is argued that the ability to obtain and maintain professional status is closely related to concrete occupational strategies and to wider social forces and arrangements of power. Such a perspective leads to a consideration of the social meaning of occupational tasks, the resources behind the emergence and continuation of professionalism, and the social consequences of professionalism.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            Transparency and accountability are keywords in corporate business, politics, and science. As part of the open science movement, many journals have started to adopt forms of open peer review beyond the closed (single- or double-blind) standard model. However, there is contrasting evidence on the impact of these innovations on the quality of peer review. Furthermore, their long-term consequences on scientists’ cooperation and competition are difficult to assess empirically. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting an agent-based model that simulates competition and status dynamics between scholars in an artificial academic system. The results would suggest that if referees are sensitive to competition and status, the transparency achieved by open peer review could backfire on the quality of the process. Although only abstract and hypothetical, our findings suggest the importance of multidimensional values of peer review and the anonymity and confidentiality of the process.",

		"abstract": "The United States relies on international and osteopathic medical graduates (“non-USMDs”) to fill one third of residency positions because of a shortage of American MD graduates (“USMDs”). Non-USMDs are often informally excluded from top residency positions, while USMDs tend to fill the most prestigious residencies. Little is known, however, about whether the training in these different settings is comparable or how it impacts patients. Drawing on 23 months of ethnographic fieldwork and 123 interviews, I compare training at two internal medicine programs: a community hospital staffing 90% non-USMDs and a university hospital staffing 99% USMDs. The community program’s structure lent itself to a hands-off approach resulting in “inconsistent autonomy.” In contrast, the university hospital supervised its residents much more regularly, resulting in “supported autonomy.” I conclude that medicine may be stratified in unexpected ways between USMDs and non-USMDs and that stratification may matter for patients.",

		"abstract": "Acute hospital units are a common location of death. Curative characteristics of the acute medical setting make it difficult to provide adequate palliative care; these characteristics include an orientation to life-prolonging treatment, an emphasis on routine or task-oriented care and a lack of priority on emotional engagement with patients. Indeed, research shows that dying patients in acute medical units often experience unmet needs at the end of life, including uncontrolled symptoms (e.g. pain, breathlessness), inadequate emotional support and poor communication. A focused ethnography was conducted on an acute medical ward in Canada to better understand how this curative/life-prolonging care environment shapes the care of dying patients. Fieldwork was conducted over a period of 10 months and included participant-observation and interviews with patients, family members and staff. On the acute medical ward, a ‘logic of care’ driven by discourses of limited resources and the demanding medical unit created a context of busyness. Staff experienced an overwhelming workload and felt compelled to create priorities, which reflected taken-for-granted values regarding the importance of curative/life-prolonging care over palliative care. This could be seen through the way staff prioritized life-prolonging practices and rationalized inconsistent and less attentive care for dying patients. These values influenced care of the dying through delaying a palliative approach to care, limiting palliative care to those with cancer and providing highly interventive end-of-life care. Awareness of these taken-for-granted values compels a reflective and critical approach to current practice and how to stimulate change.",

We demonstrate how POSH-VRE can open space to navigate and better understand organisational complexity and build capacity. Organisational complexity denotes the interrelated components of a system. POSH-VRE can be helpful within complex organisations, such as health services, because it focuses on positive healthcare practices and experiences. We exemplify this with reference to a study on brilliant community-based palliative care. Using fieldnotes and video-recordings, we reveal the value of positive recognition – or celebration; video-cameras; and courtesy, whereby we adapted to different contexts. POSH-VRE can be of scholarly, methodological, and organisational value. It enables researchers to navigate organisational complexity and co-construct findings with nonacademic experts. Furthermore, it can encourage nonacademic experts to improve practice by learning from their own capacities to navigate organisational complexity.",

We used PubMed, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases to extract English-language articles published between January 2002 and April 2015. Forty-three articles were included. The most common theories included decision-making models ( n = 14) followed by family-centered ( n = 11) and behavioral change models ( n = 7). A conceptual framework was developed using themes including context of decision making, communication and negotiation of decision making, characteristics of decision makers, goals of decision making, options and alternatives, and outcomes. Future research should enhance and apply these theories to guide research to develop patient-centered decision-making programs that facilitate informed and shared decision making at the end of life among patients with advanced illness and their caregivers.",

This article presents analysis of the ways health professionals and accompanying persons talked about admission decisions and caring roles. The authors used an ethnographic case study design involving participant observation and semi-structured interviews with 13 patients, 17 accompanying persons and 26 health care professionals in four National Health Service hospitals in south-west England. Focused analysis of interactional data revealed that professionals’ standardization of the patient–carer relationship contrasted with accompanying persons’ varied connections with patients. Accompanying persons could directly or obliquely express willingness, ambivalence and resistance to supporting patients’ care. The drive to avoid admissions can lead health professionals to deploy conversational skills to enlist accompanying persons for discharge care without exploring the meanings of their particular relationship with the patients. Taking a relationship-centered approach could improve the attention to accompanying persons as co-producers of health care and participants in decision-making.",

		"abstract": "America's health care system was built on the principle that life should be prolonged whenever possible, regardless of the costs. This commitment has often meant that patients spend their last days suffering from heroic interventions that extend their life by only weeks or months. Increasingly, this approach to end-of-life care is coming under scrutiny, from a moral as well as a financial perspective. Sociologist Roi Livne documents the rise and effectiveness of hospice and palliative care, and growing acceptance of the idea that a life consumed by suffering may not be worth living. Values at the End of Life combines an in-depth historical analysis with an extensive study conducted in three hospitals, where Livne observed terminally ill patients, their families, and caregivers negotiating treatment. Livne describes the ambivalent, conflicted moments when people articulate and act on their moral intuitions about dying. Interviews with medical staff allowed him to isolate the strategies clinicians use to help families understand their options. As Livne discovered, clinicians are advancing the idea that invasive, expensive hospital procedures often compound a patient's suffering. Affluent, educated families were more readily persuaded by this moral calculus than those of less means. Once defiant of death--or even in denial--many American families and professionals in the health care system are beginning to embrace the notion that less treatment in the end may be better treatment.--",

		"abstract": "CONTEXT: The current state of palliative care in cancer centers is not known.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the availability and degree of integration of palliative care services and to compare between National Cancer Institute (NCI) and non-NCI cancer centers in the United States.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A survey of 71 NCI-designated cancer centers and a random sample of 71 non-NCI cancer centers of both executives and palliative care clinical program leaders, where applicable, regarding their palliative care services between June and October 2009. Survey questions were generated after a comprehensive literature search, review of guidelines from the National Quality Forum, and discussions among 7 physicians with research interest in palliative oncology. Executives were also asked about their attitudes toward palliative care.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Availability of palliative care services in the cancer center, defined as the presence of at least 1 palliative care physician.\nRESULTS: A total of 142 and 120 surveys were sent to executives and program leaders, with response rates of 71% and 82%, respectively. National Cancer Institute cancer centers were significantly more likely to have a palliative care program (50/51 [98%] vs 39/50 [78%]; P = .002), at least 1 palliative care physician (46/50 [92%] vs 28/38 [74%]; P = .04), an inpatient palliative care consultation team (47/51 [92%] vs 28/50 [56%]; P < .001), and an outpatient palliative care clinic (30/51 [59%] vs 11/50 [22%]; P < .001). Few centers had dedicated palliative care beds (23/101 [23%]) or an institution-operated hospice (37/101 [37%]). The median (interquartile range) reported durations from referral to death were 7 (4-16), 7 (5-10), and 90 (30-120) days for inpatient consultation teams, inpatient units, and outpatient clinics, respectively. Research programs, palliative care fellowships, and mandatory rotations for oncology fellows were uncommon. Executives were supportive of stronger integration and increasing palliative care resources.\nCONCLUSION: Most cancer centers reported a palliative care program, although the scope of services and the degree of integration varied widely.",

		"abstract": "Studies examining individuals' preferences reflect a broad consensus that the end of life is a period during which medical care should be different from that in other periods in patients' lives. More specifically, patients, families, and health care providers believe that medical care during this unique period should be home-based and focused on ameliorating patient symptoms through minimally invasive means rather than hospital-based acute care, and focused on extending life through invasive approaches. Of great concern is that other, empirical research shows that there is a large disparity between these preferred types of medical care at the end of life and the actual patterns of medical care that is observed before death, with most patients dying in acute-care hospitals while receiving invasive therapies. Without prospective recognition of this period, medical care cannot be appropriately changed. Existing research suggests that there are few clinical tools available to health care providers to aid in making prognostic estimates. Opportunities for future research include efforts to improve the prospective identification of the end of life and communication about the end of life. Specifically, development of valid and reliable predictive algorithms to help patients, families, and health care providers to identify the beginning of the end of life would be welcomed and should ideally be focused at the population level to ensure wide applicability. Similarly, research that works to improve communication between patients and health care providers on the matter of prognosis is also needed.",

These care transitions can be distressing for family members because they signify the deterioration and impending death of their ill relative and forthcoming family bereavement. Whilst there is evidence about psychosocial support for family members providing end-of-life care at home, there is limited evidence about how this can be provided in acute hospitals during care transitions. Consequently, family members report a lack of support from hospital-based healthcare professionals.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                The aim of the study was to implement research evidence for family support at the end-of-life in acute hospital care. Informed by Participatory Learning and Action Research and Normalization Process Theory (NPT) we co-designed a context-specific intervention, the Family-Focused Support Conversation, from a detailed review of research evidence. We undertook a pilot implementation in three acute hospital Trusts in England to assess the potential for the intervention to be used in clinical practice. Pilot implementation was undertaken during a three-month period by seven clinical co-researchers - nurses and occupational therapists in hospital specialist palliative care services. Implementation was evaluated through data comprised of reflective records of intervention delivery (\n                n\n                 = 22), in-depth records of telephone implementation support meetings between research team members and co-researchers (\n                n\n                 = 3), and in-depth evaluation meetings (\n                n\n                 = 2). Data were qualitatively analysed using an NPT framework designed for intervention evaluation.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              Clinical co-researchers readily incorporated the Family-Focused Support Conversation into their everyday work. The intervention changed family support from being solely patient-focused, providing information about patient needs, to family-focused, identifying family concerns about the significance and implications of discharge and facilitating family-focused care. Co-researchers reported an increase in family members’ involvement in discharge decisions and end-of-life care planning.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              The Family-Focused Support Conversation is a novel, evidenced-based and context specific intervention. Pilot implementation demonstrated the potential for the intervention to be used in acute hospitals to support family members during end-of-life care transitions. This subsequently informed a larger scale implementation study.\n            \n            \n              Trial registration\n              n/a.",

In reaction to paternalistic communication patterns, health policy makers have advocated for patient-centered care and shared decision-making. Although these models of medical communication remain still aspirational, patients have become more engaged in advocating for their own health in encounters with physicians. I argue that the engaged patient is a more accurate conceptualization of the changing role of the patient than patient consumerism, the empowered, or expert patient. I examine how the emergence of engaged patients influences the autonomy of health professionals, relates to the rise of the internet as an alternative source of medical information, centers the role of the patient–doctor interaction in public health epidemics, and contributes to health inequities.",

		"abstract": "We propose a remedy for the discrepancy between the way political scientists analyze data with missing values and the recommendations of the statistics community. Methodologists and statisticians agree that “multiple imputation” is a superior approach to the problem of missing data scattered through one’s explanatory and dependent variables than the methods currently used in applied data analysis. The discrepancy occurs because the computational algorithms used to apply the best multiple imputation models have been slow, difficult to implement, impossible to run with existing commercial statistical packages, and have demanded considerable expertise. We adapt an algorithm and use it to implement a general-purpose, multiple imputation model for missing data. This algorithm is considerably faster and easier to use than the leading method recommended in the statistics literature. We also quantify the risks of current missing data practices, illustrate how to use the new procedure, and evaluate this alternative through simulated data as well as actual empirical examples. Finally, we offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods discussed.",

		"abstract": "End-of-life decision-making is an important area of research, and few sociological studies have considered family grief in light of end-of-life decision-making in the hospital. Drawing on in-depth interviews with family members in the intensive care unit (ICU) during an end-of-life hospitalization and into their bereavement period up to six months after the death of the patient, this article examines bereaved family members’ experiences of grief by examining three aspects from the end-of-life hospitalization and decision-making in the ICU that informed their subsequent bereavement experiences. First, this article explores how the process of advance care planning (ACP) shaped family experiences of grief, by demonstrating that even prior informal conversations around end-of-life care outside of having an advance directive in the hospital was beneficial for family members both during the hospitalization and afterwards in bereavement. Second, clinicians’ compassionate caring for both patients and families through the “little things” or small gestures were important to families during the end-of-life hospitalization and afterwards in bereavement. Third, the transition time in the hospital before the patient’s death facilitated family experiences of grief by providing a sense of support and meaning in bereavement. The findings have implications for clinicians who provide end-of-life care by highlighting salient aspects from the hospitalization that may shape family grief following the patient’s death. Most importantly, the notion that ACP as a social process may be a “gift” to families during end-of-life decision-making and carry through into bereavement can serve as a motivator to engage patients in ACP.",

		"abstract": "Socioeconomic status (SES) gradients in mortality risk are well documented, although less is known about whether the quality of older adults’ dying experiences is stratified by SES. I focus on six core components of a “good death”: pain and symptom management, acceptance, medical care that is concordant with one’s preferences, dying at home, emotional preparation, and formal preparations for end-of-life care. Analyses are based on four data sets spanning the 1980s through 2010s, a period marked by rising economic inequalities: Changing Lives of Older Couples (1986–1994), Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (1993–2010), New Jersey End of Life study (2005–2007), and Wisconsin Study of Families and Loss (2010–2014). I find evidence of SES disparities in two outcomes only: pain and advance care planning (ACP), widely considered an important step toward a “good death.” Implications for health care policy and practice, against the backdrop of the Affordable Care Act implementation, are discussed.",

Population aging has not yet run its course, Its effects exacerbated by declining retirement ages, straining pensions systems and prompting their reform.

		"abstract": "This review proposes that the end of life is a uniquely contemporary life course stage. Epidemiologic, technological, and cultural shifts over the past two centuries have created a context in which dying has shifted from a sudden and unexpected event to a protracted, anticipated transition following an incurable chronic illness. The emergence of an end-of-life stage lasting for months or even years has heightened public interest in enhancing patient well-being, autonomy, and the receipt of medical care that accords with patient and family members’ wishes. We describe key components of end-of-life well-being and highlight socioeconomic and race disparities therein, drawing on fundamental cause theory. We describe two practices that are critical to end-of-life well-being (advance care planning and hospice) and identify limitations that may undermine their effectiveness. We conclude with recommendations for future sociological research that could inform practices to enhance patient and family well-being at the end of life.",

Here, the eminent urban historian Bill Luckin re-introduces a body of work which, published together for the first time, along with new material and contextualizing notes, marks the beginning of this important strand of historiography. Luckin charts the spread of cholera, fever and the 'everyday' (but frequently deadly) infections that afflicted the inhabitants of London and its 'new manufacturing districts' between the 1830s and the end of the nineteenth century. A second part - 'Pollution and the Ills of Urban-Industrialism' - concentrates on the water and 'smoke' problems and the ways in which they came to be perceived, defined and finally brought under a degree of control. Death and Survival in Urban Britain explores the layered and interacting narratives within the framework of the urban revolution that transformed British society between 1800 and 1950.\"--Bloomsbury Publishing.",

		"abstract": "\"Palliative medicine was first recognised as a specialist field in 1987. One hundred years earlier, London based doctor William Munk published a treatise on 'easeful death' that mapped out the principles of practical, spiritual, and medical support at the end of life. In the intervening years a major process of development took place which led to innovative services, new approaches to the study and relief of pain and other symptoms, a growing interest in 'holistic' care, and a desire to gain more recognition for care at the end of life. This book traces the history of palliative medicine, from its nineteenth-century origins, to its modern practice around the world. It takes in the changing meaning of 'euthanasia', assesses the role of religious and philanthropic organisations in the creation of homes for the dying, and explores how twentieth-century doctors created a special focus on end of life care. To Comfort Always traces the rise of clinical studies, academic programmes and international collaborations to promote palliative care. It examines the continuing need to support development with evidence, and assesses the dilemmas of unequal access to services and pain relieving drugs, as well as the periodic accusations of creeping medicalization within the field. This is the first history of its kind, and the breadth of information it encompasses makes it an essential resource for those interested in the long-term achievements of palliative medicine as well as the challenges that remain.\"--",

Life-and-death issues have moved increasingly from\nprivate to public spheres of the society and are appearing more frequently in the\ncourts, the media, and the arts.

		"abstract": "Reports of unidentified flying objects and alien encounters have sparked amateur research (ufology), government investigations, and popular interest in the subject. Historically, however, scientists have generally greeted the topic with skepticism, most often dismissing ufology as pseudoscience and believers in unidentified flying objects and aliens as irrational or abnormal. Believers, in turn, have expressed doubts about the accuracy of academic science. This study examines the historical sources of the mutual mistrust between ufologists and scientists. It demonstrates that any science doubt surrounding unidentified flying objects and aliens was not primarily due to the ignorance of ufologists about science, but rather a product of the respective research practices of and relations between ufology, the sciences, and government investigative bodies.",

A strong correlation occurred between the magnitude of a measure of the total energy released in a month and the time since the previous peak in UFORs and LRs. Percentage changes in UFORs and LRs with respect to the previous month were not correlated significantly with the occurrence of larger magnitude ( M S 2.0) quakes but were moderately to strongly correlated with the numbers and percentage changes from the pre< vious month in events of smaller magnitude (1.0 4 M 2.0). These seismic events also showed a systematic variation in lag time with the larger displays of seismic energy. Peaks in both UFORs and small magnitude events occurred between 0 to 6 mo. before increments with the larger seismic energy values; the average lag was about 2 months for both phenomena. Maximum correlations between numbers of UFORs and LRs and the numbers of events of smaller magnitude occurred when increments used in analysis averaged about 3 months. These analyses indicate that systematic and intricate relationships between samples of UFORs and earthquake measures are evident when the latter reflect a more representative sample of seismic events within the test area.",

Symmetrical lag/lead multiple regression analyses gave a positive intermediate strength correlation (0.59) between the numbers of earthquakes per increment and the numbers of UFO reports (UFORs) during the previous increment only. These results are similar to UFOR-seismic temporal relationships that have been found in the central USA, Utah, Washington State, and Manitoba. These patterns strongly suggest a general relationship between reports of luminous phenomena, frequently labelled as UFOs, and consequent seismic activity.",

These reports occurred over a 3-yr. period (1974-1977) near Winnipeg, Manitoba; yet, this province has no recorded seismicity. Visual inspection of the numbers of UFORs per month during this period indicated they were strongly correlated with the amount of seismic energy released within 1000 km. The Carman episode occurred during the time of the closest and strongest recorded earthquake in the recent history (since 1950) of the area. Characteristics of the local geology and crustal morphology were considered as factors that might influence the furthest distance at which seismicity is associated with UFORs. The results were interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that most well documented episodes of UFORs refer to acmal geophysical phenomena that are generated by tectonic strain.",

Because the injection (or containment) of fluids or their percolation into the upper crust can trigger earthquakes, we predicted that reports of these anomalous luminous phenomena should display temporal lags and spatial diffusion around these sites. The hypothesis was supported around the five test sites of Derby, Colorado; Attica, New York; Rangely, Colorado; Sanford (Amarillo), Texas; and Hanford, Washington. The results support the hypothesis that luminous phenomena, often described by the contemporary label of UFOs, are associated with natural hydroseismicity and can be initiated by man-made activity.",

It is suggested that there may be a connection between some of these natural formations and Unidentified Flying Objects. Properties common to spherical formations and ball lightnings have been found. A mathematical model describing such natural phenomena as electrostatically charged multibipolar shells have been derived. The shells are assumed to consist of water molecules having their dipole moments oriented lengthwise in an electrostatic field and forming an ordered structure. The bipolar electrical charges are thought to account for both the stability of the shells and the peculiarities of motion of spherical formations. Energy point and glow effects are discussed.",

Discriminant and multiple regression analyses indicated that seismic variables that correctly classified and predicted years that contained reports of spectacular spherical luminous phenomena during the 19th century, also correctly predicted major UFO episodes during the present century. The results indicate that phenomena once labelled as odd luminosities, mysterious airships and phantom airplanes in previous decades are associated with UFOs now.",

		"abstract": "Classical medical sociological theory argues patients trust doctors in part because they are professionals. Yet in the past half-century, medicine has seen a crisis of trust as well as fundamental changes to the nature of professionalism. To probe the relationship between professionalism and trust today, we analyzed interviews with 50 psychiatric patients receiving care in diverse clinical settings. We found patients experience trust when they perceive clinicians transcending the formal bounds of professionalism. Patients find clinicians to be trustworthy when clinicians pursue connections to their patients beyond organizational strictures, cross boundaries of professional jurisdiction to provide holistic care, and embrace the limits of their professional knowledge. This dynamic of trust in professionals who transcend the profession highlights novel dimensions of contemporary professionalism, and it makes sense of a seeming contradiction in which patients have high trust in individual clinicians but low trust in institutions.",

Relying on ethnographic observations conducted in 2008, I evaluated how financial pressures shape the patient–physician relationship during the clinical encounter. To gain a financial advantage, patients attempted to reshape the relationship toward a socially intimate one, where favor and gift exchanges are more common. To ensure the rendering of services, the physician in turn allied herself with the patient, demonstrating how external parties are the barriers to affordable care. This allied relationship was tested when conflicts emerged, primarily because of the role of financial intermediaries in the clinical encounter. These conflicts resulted in the disintegration of the personal relationship, with patient and physician pitted against one another.",

Since 2006, medical experts and patient advocates have argued for putting the child’s needs central as patient-centered care. Based on audio recordings of 31 parent–clinician interactions in three clinics of disorders of sex development, we analyze how parents and clinicians decide on genital surgery. We find that clinicians and parents aim for parent-centered rather than infant-centered care. Parents receive ambivalent messages about surgery: while clinicians express caution, they also present the surgery as beneficial. We examine how parents and clinicians reach agreement about surgery—differentiating parents who push strongly for surgery from parents who do not express any preconceived preferences about surgery and parents who resist surgery. We conclude that clinicians use clinical uncertainty about surgery strategically to direct parents toward perceived clinically appropriate decisions.",

		"abstract": "Most women of reproductive age have access to highly effective contraception, and all available methods are associated with side effects. Whether a woman will experience side effects is uncertain, however, which can pose challenges for clinicians who discuss the methods with patients. In this study, we analyze 102 contraceptive counseling visits to understand how clinicians discursively construct knowledge in the context of uncertainty. We find that while some present the uncertainty of side effects in a straightforward, patient-accessible way, others negotiate their predictions by (1) differentially constructing uncertainty, suggesting that positive side effects are likely and negative side effects are unlikely, and (2) contesting uncertainty, presenting the risk of serious side effects as controllable. In the end, these strategies deemphasize consideration of negative side effects in women’s contraceptive decision making. Our results demonstrate the importance of elucidating the translation, instantiation, and construction of medical uncertainty both in theory and in practice.",

		"abstract": "The subjective nature of pain has always rendered it a point of entry for power and corresponding stratifying processes within biomedicine. The opioid crisis has further exacerbated these challenges by increasing the stakes of prescribing decisions for providers, which in turn has resulted in greater treatment disparities. Using the theoretical frame of cultural health capital (CHC) to account for these disparities in pain management as they unfold at both the macro- and the microlevel, we present findings from an interdisciplinary study of two complex care management programs in urban safety-net hospitals that serve high-utilizing patients. CHC, which considers the ways in which patient–provider interactions reflect and often reinforce broader social inequities, allows for a consideration of power as it circulates through and beyond the patient–provider encounter. Within the current sociopolitical era of pain management, attention must be paid to the stratifying processes that structure how suffering is addressed.",

		"abstract": "There is no doubt that the organization of healthcare is currently shifting, partly in response to changing macrolevel policies. Studies of healthcare policies often do not consider healthcare workers’ experiences of policy change, thus limiting our understanding of when and how policies work. This article uses longitudinal qualitative data, including participant observation and semistructured interviews with workers within hospice care as their organizations shifted in response to a Medicare policy change. Prior to the policy change, I find that the main innovation of hospice—the interdisciplinary team—is able to resist logics from the larger medical institution. However, when organizational pressures increase, managers and workers adjust in ways that reinforce medical logics and undermine the interdisciplinary team. These practices illustrate processes by which rationalization of healthcare affects workers’ experiences and the type of care available to patients.",

Although there is a growing body of research evidence about the effectiveness of different strategies, this is not easily accessible to policy makers and professionals.\nOBJECTIVES: To identify, appraise, and synthesize systematic reviews of professional educational or quality assurance interventions to improve quality of care.\nRESEARCH DESIGN: An overview was made of systematic reviews of professional behavior change interventions published between 1966 and 1998.\nRESULTS: Forty-one reviews were identified covering a wide range of interventions and behaviors. In general, passive approaches are generally ineffective and unlikely to result in behavior change. Most other interventions are effective under some circumstances; none are effective under all circumstances. Promising approaches include educational outreach (for prescribing) and reminders. Multifaceted interventions targeting different barriers to change are more likely to be effective than single interventions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the current evidence base is incomplete, it provides valuable insights into the likely effectiveness of different interventions. Future quality improvement or educational activities should be informed by the findings of systematic reviews of professional behavior change interventions.",

I develop a conceptual framework in which their decisions to use advanced technologies are informed by \"interdependent career types,\" a concept that incorporates features of the professional social context of physicians' work and the expertise they use, and reflects how medicine distributes expertise via formal and informal referral structures. I draw on data regarding specialized physicians' differentiated use of this technology over five years as well as interviews with those who continue to use the technology and those who have abandoned it. I argue that interdependent career types stratify physicians' standpoints on multiple dimensions of medical work-including those related to their concerns about reputation, inclinations toward risk, and preferences regarding the use of their bodies.",

		"abstract": "A largely uncoordinated patient safety movement arose in response to the Institute of Medicine’s 1999 report on patient safety, To Err Is Human. Two key outcomes have resulted from that movement: (a) new guidelines that enlarge requirements for documenting compliance with patient safety data and (b) a new obligation for health care organizations to create a “safety culture” based on the “science” of safety. The organizational title patient safety officer (PSO) designates a member of an emerging occupation charged with assuming these enlarged responsibilities. This article seeks, first, to describe the emergence of this new organizational role, the PSO; second, to identify the new tensions that task and mission inflation have created for PSOs; and third, to examine how PSOs manage the tensions between their increased core work task and their new professional mission as agents of organizational change. Drawing on interviews conducted with 32 PSOs, 127 nurses, and 36 physicians in 17 surgical departments across 5 states in the United States from 2012 to 2015, the authors find that PSOs most commonly resolve the tension between core work activity and professional mission by focusing on their task as agents of audit and compliance. The authors find, as well, that when PSOs attempt to use their expanded role as social reformers to change behaviors in surgery, they must overcome the resistance of frontline workers. They require cooperation from executives and surgeons to effect change. When this support is unavailable, PSOs lose their voice and may abandon efforts to improve safety.",

		"abstract": "Over the past decade, different parties in the health care field have developed and disseminated clinical practice guidelines as part of evidence-based medicine. These formal tools based on a scientific evaluation of the research literature purport to tell health care professionals how to practice medicine. Because clinical practice guidelines shift the knowledge base in the health care field through standardization, they remain controversial within and outside medicine. In this paper, we evaluate the predictive accuracy of four medical professionalization theories--functionalism, Freidson's theory of professional dominance, deprofessionalization theory, and the theory of countervailing powers--to account for (1) the shift from pathophysiology to epidemiology with guidelines, (2) the creation of practice guidelines, and (3) the effects of clinical practice guidelines on the autonomy of health professionals. In light of the mixed predictive record of professionalization theories, we conclude with a need for \"evidence-based sociology\" and a recalibration of basic premises underlying professionalization theories.",

What remains unclear is the role of occupations in explaining workers’ responses to change. Using survey data ( N = 226) and in-depth interviews with workers ( N = 33) in a neonatal intensive care unit as it transitioned from a multiple-occupancy ward design to single-patient rooms, this study examines occupational discrepancies in reactions to the change. Findings reveal that misgivings about the move vary considerably across groups and illustrate the enduring significance of occupational identity.",

		"abstract": "The term patient noncompliance emerged in the 1970s as a tool for analyzing why people do not follow medical directives. Despite its early popularity, the term has languished in sociology while flourishing in biomedical arenas. It seems flaccid in a contemporary healthcare context as it overestimates physician authority and is tone-deaf to biomedicalization. I draw from sociological and anthropological traditions, as well as qualitative interviews with terminally ill patients ( N = 26) and their caregivers ( N = 16), to consider facets of a biomedicalized health experience and implications for an updated vision of compliance. First, pathways to care have proliferated under biomedicalization. With increased pathways comes increased need for understanding how treatment plans are socially constituted and assessed. Finally, increased complexity demands a more diverse vocabulary for understanding health related decisions. This paper is a call to sociologists to take the lead in transforming and updating this consequential concept.",

		"abstract": "In this article, we develop an exploratory analysis of some of the interactional strategies developed by palliative care (PC) professionals in order to prepare end-of-life (EoL) talks with patients and their families, namely in the frame of specifically social problem-solving work which they develop on a daily basis. In this sense, our object of analysis is not EoL talks in themselves, but the broader social processes that tend to precede them in PC, that is, all the work both of approaching the patient and his or her family and of coordination within the teams that PC professionals routinely do in order to propitiate EoL talk. In this way, we don’t envisage EoL talks as a conversation between two parties, with a patient on one side and a doctor on the other side, but as a wider social process which relies upon strong and previous professional engagement. The analysis conducted herein was carried out on data collected under the projects ETIC – Managing EoL trajectories in palliative care: a study on the work of healthcare professionals (Ref. PTDC/SOC-SOC/30092/2017) and Building paths towards death: an analysis of everyday work in palliative care (Ref. PTDC/CS-SOC/119621/2010), both financed by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT); in particular the data obtained through 17 months (12 in the first project and 5 in the second one, still in progress) of ethnographic observation carried out at two hospital internment units providing PC in Mainland Portugal and 42 (37 in the first project and 5 in the second one, still in progress) in-depth interviews to professionals in PC – physicians, nurses, and social workers. As main results, we present several theoretical and empirical elements relevant to the analysis of the field of EoL communication in the context of interactions between healthcare professionals, patients and their families. Following earlier studies on the same theme, we show how the work of preparing EoL conversations refers to a broader social process preceding those conversations. We believe that our findings may contribute to elucidating this dimension of the intervention of PC professionals, thus being instrumental for the future definition of systematised guidelines and recommendations in the framework of PC.",

Unlike in physical sciences, sociologists work backward to construct theoretical puzzles from their data. Sociologists risk puzzling for puzzles’ sake, and in so doing, they reify categories and concepts that are not necessary or useful to their empirical material at hand. This essay examines mostly qualitative sociologists’ conventions for puzzling and suggests alternatives rooted in thick description of empirics.",

Physicians, however, frequently encounter numerous barriers when trying to discharge patients. Presenting ethnographic and interview data collected from September 2010 to September 2013, this paper examines one of the most difficult discharge cases physicians encounter on the internal medicine service at a U.S. teaching hospital: resistant patients—patients and families who refuse to leave the hospital. As physicians try to discharge resistant patients, they are met with conflicting financial and professional incentives. Drawing from the sociological literature on professions, managerialism, and consumerism, I analyze the strategies physicians develop to manage these difficult discharge cases.",

The discussion might include questions about what balances of treatment burden and benefit the patient can tolerate and about emotional, cognitive, spiritual, and family factors that underlie the request. After this initial exploration, the clinician can propose a philosophy of treatment and make recommendations that capture the patient's values and preferences in light of the medical condition. Clinicians should respond to emotional reactions, directly negotiate disagreements, and use harm-reduction strategies for the relatively infrequent instances in which patients continue to request burdensome therapy that is unlikely to help. By using this approach, patients, families, and clinicians will be better able to understand each other and join together to develop a treatment approach that best respects patient and family values in light of what is medically achievable.",

		"abstract": "Ethnographers often study those who periodically meet to interact in multiple venues. This article focuses on how people who share and engage in tasks in recurrently visited venues define and change their social projects’ problems and solutions. To address the complexities of this “meta-work,” I introduce the concept of “tethers.” Tethers are links across venues that people use to set and shift these problems and solutions that are continuously being contested. Drawing on examples from the author’s fieldwork and other ethnographic accounts of professional work, I examine three types of tethers: focal participants, things, and language. Paying attention to tethers also results in practical implications for managing subjects’ use of the ethnographer as a tether, making decisions about what venues to observe, and developing strategies for focusing one’s observations when in those venues. I argue that a focus on subjects’ use of tethers across venues helps mitigate the challenges ethnographers face when accounting for the influence of temporally and geographically distant sites of recurrent interaction.",

		"abstract": "This study examines how patients conceptualize “responsibility” for their healthcare and make sense of the complex boundaries between patient and professional roles. Focusing on the specific case of patient safety, narrative methods were used to analyze semistructured interviews with 28 people recently discharged from hospital in England. We present a typology of attribution, which demonstrates that patients’ attributions of responsibility to staff and/or to patients are informed by two dimensions of responsibility: basis and contingency. The basis of responsibility is the reason for holding an individual or group responsible. The contingency of responsibility is the extent to which that attribution is contextually situated. The article contributes to knowledge about responsibility in complex organizational environments and offers a set of conceptual tools for exploring patients’ understanding of responsibility in such contexts. There are implications for addressing patient engagement in care, within and beyond the field of patient safety.",

Analysis of transcripts from 20 meetings reveals physician identity is developed through ideological discourse that produces and reproduces systems of domination that privilege scientific medicine and marginalize humanistic approaches. Findings indicate how, in a socialization context uniquely focused on discourse, communication functions to construct a professional identity grounded in the principles of the biomedical model. Although medical residents deviate from traditional ideology by articulating the voice of the lifeworld, faculty physicians counter these moves by asserting the voice of medicine. The authors draw conclusions regarding identity formation and the socialization practices of medical education.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            In this article, we use newly developed statistical methods to examine the generative processes that give rise to widespread patterns in friendship networks. The methods incorporate both traditional demographic measures on individuals (age, sex, and race) and network measures for structural processes operating on individual, dyadic, and triadic levels. We apply the methods to adolescent friendship networks in 59 U.S. schools from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We model friendship formation as a selection process constrained by individuals’ sociality (propensity to make friends), selective mixing in dyads (friendships within race, grade, or sex categories are differentially likely relative to cross-category friendships), and closure in triads (a friend’s friends are more likely to become friends), given local population composition. Blacks are generally the most cohesive racial category, although when whites are in the minority, they display stronger selective mixing than do blacks when blacks are in the minority. Hispanics exhibit disassortative selective mixing under certain circumstances; in other cases, they exhibit assortative mixing but lack the higher-order cohesion common in other groups. Grade levels are always highly cohesive, while females form triangles more than males. We conclude with a discussion of how network analysis may contribute to our understanding of sociodemographic structure and the processes that create it.",

		"abstract": "Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years? Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.",

Yet, it is not clear what lawyers do in such quintessentially legal settings: conclusions from past research are bedeviled by a lack of clear theory and inconsistencies in research design. Conceptualizing litigation work in terms of professional expertise, I conduct a theoretically grounded synthesis of the findings of extant studies of lawyers’ impact on civil case outcomes. Using an innovative combination of statistical techniques—meta-analysis and nonparametric bounding—the present study transcends previous work to reveal a domain of consensus for lawyers’ effect on case outcomes and to explore why this effect varies so greatly across past studies. For the types of cases researched to date, knowledge of substantive law explains surprisingly little of lawyers’ advantage compared to lay people appearing unrepresented. Instead, lawyers’ impact is greatest when they assist in navigating relatively simple (to lawyers) procedures and where their relational expertise helps courts follow their own rules. Findings for law generalize to other professions, where substantive and relational expertise may shape the conduct and consequences of professional work.",

Our empirical base consists of 42 networks from four kinds of species (humans, nonhuman primates, nonprimate mammals, and birds) and covering distinct types of relations such as influence, grooming, and agonistic encounters. The general problem is to determine whether networks are similarly structured despite their surface differences. The methodology we propose is generally applicable to the characterization and comparison of network-level social structures across multiple settings, such as different organizations, communities, or social groups, and to the examination of sources of variability in network structure. We first fit a p* model (Wasserman and Pattison 1996) to each network to obtain estimates for effects of six structural properties on the probability of the graph. We then calculate predicted tie probabilities for each network, using both its own parameter estimates and the estimates from every other network in the collection. Comparison is based on the similarity between sets of predicted tie probabilities. We then use correspondence analysis to represent the similarities among all 42 networks and interpret the resulting configuration using information about the species and relations involved. Results show that similarities among the networks are due more to the kind of relation than to the kind of animal.",

		"abstract": "This special issue of Social Studies of Science centers on the topic of regulation in medicine and, in particular, on the notion of regulatory objectivity, defined as a new form of objectivity in biomedicine that generates conventions and norms through concerted programs of action based on the use of a variety of systems for the collective production of evidence. The papers in the special issue suggest ways in which the notion of regulatory objectivity can be tested, extended, revised, or superseded by more appropriate notions. They insist on the need to examine more closely clinical-therapeutic (and not just clinical-research) activities, and to pay more attention to the activities of regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration and to standard-setting organizations. They call attention to the professional and organizational activities surrounding the mobilization of conventions for regulating clinical practices. Finally, they provide material that can help us to think about how analytical notions such as regulatory objectivity may or may not inform interventionist research projects.",

		"abstract": "\"Social networks fundamentally shape our lives. Networks channel the ways that information, emotions, and diseases flow through populations. Networks reflect differences in power and status in settings ranging from small peer groups to international relations across the globe. Network tools even provide insights into the ways that concepts, ideas and other socially generated contents shape culture and meaning. As such, the rich and diverse field of social network analysis has emerged as a central tool across the social sciences. This Handbook provides an overview of the theory, methods, and substantive contributions of this field. The thirty-three chapters move through the basics of social network analysis aimed at those seeking an introduction to advanced and novel approaches to modeling social networks statistically. The Handbook includes chapters on data collection and visualization, theoretical innovations, links between networks and computational social science, and how social network analysis has contributed substantively across numerous fields. As networks are everywhere in social life, the field is inherently interdisciplinary and this Handbook includes contributions from leading scholars in sociology, archaeology, economics, statistics, and information science among others\"--",

The same comparisons were made exploring clinical trials from 1902 to 2005. Data were collated in five year groups from 1970 onward using a highly specific search phrase.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The proportion of all Ovid Medline publications relating to palliative and hospice care rose from 0.08% in 1970 to 0.38% of the literature in 2005. In the same time, clinical trials increased from 0.96% to 7.22% of the palliative care literature published. By 2005, one in every 122 clinical trials published in the literature as a whole was in palliative or hospice care. The rate of growth in palliative care clinical trials as a proportion of all palliative and hospice publications was on average 1.4 times greater than in the corresponding general literature. More than one half of these studies were reported in just 43 journals, most of which were not specialist palliative and hospice care journals.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              Given the diversity of journals in which clinical studies related to hospice and palliative care appear, there is a key challenge for clinicians in finding ways that will allow currency of practice in a broad and rapidly changing field.",

		"abstract": "Chapter 1 outlines the key principles that guide interview-based research and highlights the unique contributions this can yield. Conducting depth interviews places each participant’s voice at the heart of the study, giving participants an opportunity to tell their stories in their own words and to think more deeply about their experiences than is usually possible with other methods. Through careful questioning, concentrated listening, and focused follow-up probing, interviewers invite further exploration that encourages people to share their life experiences, describe the social contexts surrounding these experiences, and consider their personal reactions to them, including the meaning they attribute to life events and the accounts, motivations, and actions these events engender. Then, through systematic analysis of how each piece of information stands in relationship to the other information offered by that participant and all the others, it becomes possible to chart the dynamic processes that shape life trajectories and link individual actions to larger social structures. This enables interviewers to address their original question(s) and any new ones that emerge to discover empirical patterns and develop theoretical insights.",

The meaning of bad news to the patient may be quite different than the medical or the personal meaning to the physician. Differences in perception must be explored and understood before the common ground necessary for joint decision making is established. Initial patient responses can be divided into three categories: (1) basic psychophysiologic (fight-flight or conservation-withdrawal), (2) cognitive, and (3) affective. Responses vary considerably depending on the meaning of the diagnosis to the patient, the degree of immediate threat, and the patient's previous experience with illness. Desired outcomes of the initial meeting include (1) minimizing aloneness and isolation for both patient and physician; (2) achieving a common perception of the problem; (3) giving information tailored to the immediate needs of the patient; (4) addressing immediate medical needs, including the risk of suicide; (5) responding to immediate discomforts; and (6) ensuring a basic plan for follow-up. Though all clinicians deliver bad news, few have had formal training or open exploration of the profound potential impact of the experience.",

		"abstract": "Sociology and other social sciences struggle to emulate a model of scientific evidence that is often inappropriate. Not only do social researchers encounter special limits, but they are also handicapped by a distorted and idealized picture of practices in the “hard sciences.” Ironically, while often obliged to use data of lower quality, sociology employs standards for evaluating a theory that are not attained in the hard sciences. After a brief review of these obstacles, we describe a set of procedures for using empirical data to rigorously evaluate theories and hypotheses without resorting to the mimicking of hard science. The interaction between theory and evidence normally involves deriving implications from the theory (usually referred to as hypotheses) and then ascertaining how closely the empirical evidence meets these implications. The appropriateness of the implications is a key factor in the entire operation, linking as they do the data and the theory. The evaluation of a theory is no better than the theory's implications (as generated by the investigator) coupled with the quality and appropriateness of the evidence. It is our impression, however, that because this step is insufficiently addressed, there are unnecessary problems in the evaluation of theories. We use the term “Implication Analysis” to describe our efforts to review and improve current procedures.",

The book is primarily designed for research studies with an applied focus, but is also useful for theoretically oriented qualitative research. The book covers all aspects of the qualitative data analysis process including planning, data preparation, identification of themes, codebook development and code application, reliability and inter-coder agreement, data reduction techniques, comparative techniques, integration with quantitative data, and software considerations. The book describes what the authors call \"applied thematic analysis\", because it is the approach predominantly used in applied qualitative studies (and increasingly in academic contexts). The method employs a phenomenological approach to data analysis which has a primary aim of describing the experiences and perceptions of research participants. The approach presented is similar to Grounded Theory - in that it is inductive, content-driven, and searches for themes within textual data - and is complementary to Grounded Theory on many levels. However, within an applied context a phenomenological approach is primarily concerned with characterizing and summarizing perceptions and lived experiences and applying the results to a particular research problem, rather than building and assessing theoretical models\"--",

It is argued that existing literature on the topic is fragmented and predominantly focused on informational rather than social aspects of secrecy. The paper distinguishes between formal and informal secrecy and theorizes the social processes of these in terms of identity and control. It is proposed that organizational secrecy be added to the analytical repertoire of organization studies.",

		"abstract": "Sociologists theorize that people comply with the dictates of states and other organizations out of self-interest or because of the perceived legitimacy of those in authority. Some organizations, however, are based on lies, or secrets, and it would seem that these should be very short-lived, given how easy it is for the truth to escape. This article lays the foundations of a sociology of deception, focusing on lies and secrets successfully maintained for years or even decades. The ideas of Goffman and Simmel provide a theoretical starting point. Then Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme is considered as a case study. Drawing on that and other examples, the article culminates in a theory that distinguishes between barriers to knowing, barriers to asking, barriers to telling, barriers to perceiving, barriers to believing, and barriers to acting. Together, these may counter the natural entropic tendency for information to leak and diffuse, in part because the effectiveness of one sort of barrier may offset imperfections in others.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents an ethnographic account of surgical operations as encounters of two disciplined bodies — a parcelled `patient-body', and an aggregated `surgeon-body'. It describes the practices of making bodies operable, of cooperating and of creating anatomical visibility by means of highly skilled manipulations and optical technology. The discussion relates features of surgical practice to two issues raised in science studies: (1) Ritual aspects of scientific work; how does a medical science deal with the life-world esteem for its object?; and (2) The relation of experience and representation; how do patients' bodies come to embody the properties of anatomical pictures? A constructivist interpretation is offered: the anatomical body is an accomplishment of the sculptural practice of operations.",

		"abstract": "In this article, we take stock of the institutional logics perspective and highlight opportunities for new scholarship. While we celebrate the growth and generativity of the literature on institutional logics, we also note that there has been a troubling tendency in recent work to use logics as analytical tools, feeding disquiet about reification and reductionism. Seeding a broader scholarly agenda that addresses such weaknesses in the literature, we highlight nascent efforts that aim to more systematically understand institutional logics as complex, dynamic phenomena in their own right. In doing so, we argue for more research that probes how logics cohere and endure by unpacking the role of values, the centrality of practice, and the governance dynamics of institutional logics and their orders. Furthermore, we encourage bridging the study of institutional logics with various literatures, including ethnomethodology, phenomenology, professions, elites, world society, and the old institutionalism, to enhance progress in these directions.\n            Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Sociology, Volume 47 is July 2021.

Based on video-recorded observations, we examine geneticists as they return exome sequencing results to families. We find that in consultations, clinical geneticists’ interpretations of genomic findings frequently go beyond the laboratory report. The news delivery offers parents insight into the basis of clinicians’ judgment but also invites parents’ involvement in the determination of genetic causality. Through this process, clinicians and parents collaborate to define the boundaries of uncertainty. We show that through collectively managing the causal ambiguities of genomic findings, clinicians and parents enact a care relationship that works to assuage underlying feelings of diagnostic uncertainty.",

Research focuses on patients challenging medical authority but indicates these confrontations are uncommon and providers seldom relinquish their authority in response. Using rare data of 75 audio recordings of adolescent vaccine discussions during clinical encounters and interviews with and observations of medical staff, I examine how staff leverage or abandon their medical authority to convince parents to vaccinate. I find medical professionals use less authority when at risk of stigmatizing patients: Medical professionals are less authoritative when recommending human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination versus other adolescent vaccines, particularly when addressing the need to vaccinate before sexual onset due to concerns of labeling the child as sexually active. Medical staff defer to parents in ways that potentially discourage HPV vaccine uptake: They encourage HPV vaccination less than other vaccines and infrequently challenge parents’ sex-related reasons for vaccine refusal.",

		"abstract": "Over the past decades, professional medical authority has been transformed due to internal and external pressures, including weakened institutional support and patient-centered care. Today’s patients are more likely to resist treatment recommendations. We examine how patient resistance to treatment recommendations indexes the strength of contemporary professional authority. Using conversation analytic methods, we analyze 39 video recordings of patient-clinician encounters involving pediatric epilepsy patients in which parents resist recommended treatments. We identify three distinct grounds for parental resistance to treatments: preference-, fear-, and experience-based resistance. Clinicians meet these grounds with three corresponding persuasion strategies ranging from pressuring, to coaxing, to accommodating. Rather than giving parents what they want, physicians preserve their professional authority, adjusting responses based on whether the resistance threatens their prerogative to prescribe. While physicians are able to convert most resistance into acceptance, resistance has the potential to change the treatment recommendation and may lead to changed communication styles.",

Institutional prestige significantly shapes faculty placements. Nearly half of planning faculty graduated from Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Cornell, and University of North Carolina (UNC)-Chapel Hill. Faculty are predominantly hired in similar or lower ranking programs with little upward mobility, after accounting for demographics and program factors. While race and gender did not have a significant relationship to placements, the findings demonstrate how status-based inequities are perpetuated through elite programs and constrain faculty representation.",

A comprehensive study of the structure and dynamics of the US professoriate would elucidate the effects of these efforts and the processes that shape scholarship more broadly. Here we analyse the academic employment and doctoral education of tenure-track faculty at all PhD-granting US universities over the decade 2011–2020, quantifying stark inequalities in faculty production, prestige, retention and gender. Our analyses show universal inequalities in which a small minority of universities supply a large majority of faculty across fields, exacerbated by patterns of attrition and reflecting steep hierarchies of prestige. We identify markedly higher attrition rates among faculty trained outside the United States or employed by their doctoral university. Our results indicate that gains in women’s representation over this decade result from demographic turnover and earlier changes made to hiring, and are unlikely to lead to long-term gender parity in most fields. These analyses quantify the dynamics of US faculty hiring and retention, and will support efforts to improve the organization, composition and scholarship of the US academic workforce.",

		"abstract": "When screening candidates, organizations often give preference to certain applicants on the basis of their familial ties. This “legacy preference,” particularly widespread in college admissions, has been criticized for contributing to inequality and class reproduction. Despite this, studies continue to report that legacies are persistently admitted at higher rates than non-legacies. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework of three distinct sense-making strategies at play when decision-makers screen applicants into their organizations—the meritocratic, material, and diversity logics. We then apply this framework to investigate how legacy preferences either support or undermine each organizational logic using comprehensive data on the population of applicants seeking admission into one elite U.S. college. We find strong support for the material logic at the cost of the other two organizational logics: legacies make better alumni after graduation and have wealthier parents who are materially-positioned to be more generous donors than non-legacy parents. Contrary to the meritocratic logic, we find that legacies are neither more qualified applicants nor better students academically. From a diversity standpoint, legacies are less racially diverse than non-legacies. We conclude with a discussion of our study’s implications for understanding the role of family relationships and nepotism in today’s organizational selection processes.",

Unfortunately, empirical evidence is lacking about how hiring professionals from high or low-status actors, especially status that is obtained through third-party evaluation, impact the focal firm’s status. This research examines employee mobility across the largest law firms in the United States from 2010 to 2016 and employs fixed effects modeling to estimate associations among the status of firms from which partners were hired, network centrality, and the organizational status of hiring firms. Results showed that firms’ status increased when they hired, on average, from high-status firms, and that this association was stronger amongst more centrally located firms. Namely, we found that although the impact of sending firms’ status has a significant impact on the focal firms’ status, such an effect depends on network centrality of the sending firm. These results support the notion of status portability as well as the importance of the firm’s network position for status enhancement.",

		"abstract": "Why do many hosts accept costly avian brood parasitism even when parasitic eggs and nestlings differ dramatically in appearance from their own? Scientists argue that evolutionary lag or equilibrium can explain this evolutionary enigma. Few, however, consider the potential of parasitic birds to enforce acceptance by destroying eggs or nestlings of hosts that eject parasitic eggs and thereby reject parasitism. This retaliatory “mafia” behavior has been reported in one species of parasitic cuckoo but never in parasitic cowbirds. Here we present experimental evidence of mafia behavior in the brown-headed cowbird (\n              Molothrus ater\n              ), a widely distributed North American brood parasite. We manipulated ejection of cowbird eggs and cowbird access to predator-proof nests in a common host to test experimentally for mafia behavior. When cowbird access was allowed, 56% of “ejector” nests were depredated compared with only 6% of “accepter” nests. No nests were destroyed when cowbird access was always denied or when access was denied after we removed cowbird eggs, indicating that cowbirds were responsible. Nonparasitized nests were depredated at an intermediate rate (20%) when cowbirds were allowed access, suggesting that cowbirds may occasionally “farm” hosts to create additional opportunities for parasitism. Cowbirds parasitized most (85%) renests of the hosts whose nests were depredated. Ejector nests produced 60% fewer host offspring than accepter nests because of the predatory behavior attributed to cowbirds. Widespread predatory behaviors in cowbirds could slow the evolution of rejection behaviors and further threaten populations of some of the >100 species of regular cowbird hosts.",

Ecology is the science of how organisms interact with each other and with their environment, and how such interactions create self-organising communities and ecosystems. This science touches us all. The food we eat, the water we drink, the natural resources we use, our physical and mental health, and much of our cultural heritage are to a large degree products of ecological -- also shaped social and cultural perspectives on the environment, a process that influences politics of the environment. Ghazoul concludes by considering the future of ecology, particularly in the light of current and future environmental challenges.ABOUT THE SERIES:The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Becker, the consummate sociologist, both analyzes how the professional context of academia contributes to writing problems and offers concrete advice, based on his own experiences and those of his students and colleagues, for overcoming them and gaining confidence as a writer. While the underlying challenges have remained the same over the years, the context in which academic writers work has changed dramatically, thanks to technology and new institutional pressures. This new edition has been updated throughout to reflect these changes, offering a new generation of scholars and students encouragement to write about society or any other scholarly topic clearly and persuasively\"--",

Standards are ubiquitous but underappreciated tools for regulating and organizing social life in modernity, and they lurk in the background of many sociological works. Reviewing the relevance of standards and standardization in diverse theoretical traditions and sociological subfields, we point to the emergence and institutionalization of standards, the difficulties of making standards work, resistance to standardization, and the multiple outcomes of standards. Rather than associating standardization with totalizing narratives of globalization or dehumanization, we call for careful empirical analysis of the specific and unintended consequences of different sorts of standards operating in distinct social domains.",

		"abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between palliative medicine and the wider medical world. It draws on data from a focus group study in which doctors from a range of specialties talked about developing palliative care for patients with heart failure. In outlining views of the organisation of care, participants engaged in a process of negotiation about the roles and expertise of their own, and other, specialties. Our analysis considers the expertise of palliative medicine with reference to its technical and indeterminate components. It shows how these are used to promote and challenge boundaries between medical specialties and with nursing. The boundaries constructed on palliative medicine's technical contribution to care are regarded as particularly coherent within orthodox medicine. In contrast, its indeterminate expertise, represented by the 'holistic' and 'psychosocial' agendas, is potentially compromising in a medical world that prizes science and rationality. We show how the coherence of both kinds of expertise is contested by moves to extend palliative care beyond its traditional temporal (end-of-life) and pathological (cancer) fields of practice.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: No studies have evaluated the consultation process or attempted to define a standardized approach that could improve communication and patient outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE: To perform a qualitative analysis of emergency medicine (EM) consultation to reveal its complexity and elucidate strategies and frameworks for physician-to-physician communication.\nMETHODS: Data were collected in three phases: informal interviews conducted in an emergency department (ED), 10-question surveys given to a subset of EM and specialty physicians, and semi-structured 1-h group interviews using open-ended questions to further explore issues and trends elicited from the survey responses. In addition, we conducted an extensive literature search focused on health care and business consultation and communication.\nRESULTS: Seventy-six percent (29 of 38) of emergency and specialty physicians completed the 10-question survey in its entirety. Three themes were identified from the survey responses: organizational skills, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge. Of 95 total comments, 41 (43%) focused on organizational skills, 26 (27%) on interpersonal and communication skills, and 28 (30%) on medical knowledge. There were 29 comments regarding poor consultations: 15 issues with organization, 6 with interpersonal and communication skills, and 8 with medical knowledge. The literature search revealed several models and types of consultation, but no standard algorithm currently exists.\nCONCLUSIONS: We recommend focusing on organizational skills, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge when teaching ED consultation and present a conceptual framework of the Five Cs Consultation Model: contact, communication, core question, collaboration, and closing the loop.",

		"abstract": "Primary health care (PHC) is a systems perspective for examining the provision of essential health care for all. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach to health care delivery is associated with effective delivery and care providers' enrichment. Yet data regarding multidisciplinary practice within PHC are limited. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative descriptive study was to better understand team-based PHC practice in the US. Aims included (a) describing nursing faculty involvement in PHC, (b) analyzing ways that multidisciplinary work was enacted, and (c) recommending strategies for multidisciplinary PHC practice. After institutional review board (IRB) protocol approval, data collection occurred by: (a) surveying faculty/staff in a Midwestern nursing college (N=94) about their PHC practice, and (b) interviewing a purposive sample of nursing faculty/staff identified with PHC (n=10) and their health professional collaborators (n=10). Survey results (28% return rate) were summarized, interview notes were transcribed, and a systematic process of content analysis applied. Study findings show team practice is valued because health issues are complex, requiring different types of expertise; and because teams foster comprehensive care and improved resource use. Mission, membership attributes, and leadership influence teamwork. Though PHC is not a common term, nurses and their collaborators readily associated their practice with a PHC ethos. PHC practice requires understanding community complexity and engaging with community, family, and individual viewpoints. Though supports exist for PHC in the US, participants identified discord between their view of population needs and the health care system. The following interpretations arise from this study: PHC does not explicitly frame health care activity in the US, though some practitioners are committed to its ethics; and, teamwork within PHC is associated with better health care and rewarding professional experience. Nurses integrate PHC in multiple roles and are experts at aspects of PHC teamwork.",

		"abstract": "Previous studies suggest that psychiatric patients mirror the behaviors of the staff members who treat them, but there is little empirical evidence about how staff dynamics affect patients over time. The goals of this study were to examine associations between: (1) team leader discipline and mutual respect among treatment team members; and (2) mutual respect among team members and improvements in patient quality of life. Two models were tested on data from psychiatric treatment teams within the US Veterans Administration. The first examined associations between the discipline of each team's emergent leader and the level of mutual respect among that team's members. The second model tested associations between mutual respect among staff and changes over time in patients' quality of life. The subjects for model 1 were psychiatric staff members (n=785) whose responses were aggregated for team-level analyses (n=78). Mutual respect was highest in social worker-led teams and lowest in physician-led teams. The subjects for model 2 were 1,638 seriously mentally ill patients in 44 of the units examined in the first model. When mutual respect among staff was greater, patients improved more over time in their satisfaction with the quality of their housing, relations with families, social life, and finances. Together, these analyses imply that mutual respect may improve patient outcomes and that leadership by some disciplines may facilitate such dynamics. In general, leaders may consider learning from other disciplines' strengths to improve their impact.",

		"abstract": "Efforts to 'modernize' the clinical workforce of the English National Health Service have sought to reconfigure the responsibilities of professional groups in pursuit of more effective, joined-up service provision. Such efforts have met resistance from professions eager to protect their jurisdictions, deploying legitimacy claims familiar from the insights of the sociology of professions. Yet to date few studies of professional boundaries have grounded these insights in the specific context of policy challenges to the inter- and intra-professional division of labour, in relation to the medical profession and other health-related occupations. In this paper we address this gap by considering the experience of newly instituted general practitioners with a special interest (GPSIs) in genetics, introduced to improve genetics knowledge and practice in primary care. Using qualitative data from four comparative case studies, we discuss how an established intra-professional division of labour within medicine-between clinical geneticists and general practitioners-was opened, negotiated and reclosed in these sites. We discuss the contrasting attitudes towards the nature of genetics knowledge and its application of GPSIs and geneticists, and how these were used to advance conflicting visions of what the nascent GPSI role should involve. In particular, we show how the claims to knowledge of geneticists and GPSIs interacted with wider policy pressures to produce a rather more conservative redistribution of power and responsibility across the intra-professional boundary than the rhetoric of modernization might suggest.",

A boundary framework is used to articulate how surgeons’, intensivists’, and nurses’ communication practices shape and are shaped by their respective disciplinary perspectives and experiences. Through 50 hours of observations and 43 interviews, these health care providers are found to engage in seven communication behaviors that either mitigate or magnify three contested symbolic boundaries: expertise, patient ownership, and decisional authority. Where these boundaries are successfully mitigated, experiences of collaborative, high-quality patient care are produced; by contrast, boundary magnification produces conflict and perceptions of unsafe patient care. Findings reveal that high quality and safe patient care are produced through complex social and cultural interactions among surgeons, intensivists, and nurses that are also expressions of knowledge and power. This enhances our understanding of why current quality improvement efforts targeting communication may be ineffective.",

It sets out, above all, to demonstrate how the frontiers between the different medical specialities act, on the one hand, as articulating mechanisms to be found in the division of medical work and, on the other hand, as barriers to the interaction of the various skills. Through a more searching study of the division of labour between surgeons and liver specialists (hepatologists) and surgeons and anaesthetics, we highlight the contrast between those two sets of relations.This illustrates the boundaries and articulation that exist between medical technocracies. The key theoretical guidelines are drawn from medical sociology and sociology of professions. The research methodology includes participant observation in a liver transplantation hospital unit and on site interviews. By using data gathered from physicians actually working in such areas where boundaries have been drawn between surgeons and anaesthesiologists and surgeons and liver specialists, we propose to understand how different medical skills are negotiated between the different groups and where the social arrangements are the result of processes of interaction between the different specialities, which are constantly being reorganized and redefined.",

		"abstract": "This paper examines the social construction of diagnosis and illness in several ways. First, I discuss the centrality of social construction in medical sociology. Next I discuss the major role of diagnosis in social construction, leading to the need for a sociology of diagnosis. I emphasize controversial and conflictual diagnoses, as a first step toward a more general sociology of diagnosis. Then I put forth a typology of social construction, involving four combinations based on whether a condition is generally accepted and whether a biomedical definition is applied. Next I detail a series of stages in the social construction of a condition. In that process, my primary concern is the initial social discovery, which is essentially a matter of diagnosis, with a secondary emphasis on illness experience. This is followed by stages of treatment and outcome, which recursively affect social construction. I conclude by noting the health policy implications of the social constructionist perspective.",

The predictive efficiency of six independent variables: sex, age at Ph.D., years between bachelor's degree and Ph.D., age at first publication, publication before Ph.D., and quality of department of doctoral training is assessed via regression analysis. A seventh variable-year of Ph.D.-is entered into the regression equation as a control. The standardized partial regression coefficients indicate that only age at first publication and publication before Ph.D. exert important independent effects upon research productivity. Of the four remaining independent variables, sex emerged as a particularly weak predictor of publication output. Possible reasons for these results, as well as directions for future research, are presented and discussed.",

Such evaluation arises from the application of concepts of social worth common in the larger society and from staff concepts of appropriate work role. The process, however, is not a simple cause-effect matter, but the product of a reciprocal relationship between the attributes of the client and the categories of the staff. Emergency-department staff, like other service occupations, attempt to establish mechanisms of control over inappropriate demands for service.",

Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence. --",

		"abstract": "The social autopsy takes the death of a set of individuals as its starting point and then critically and systematically examines social and political conditions to explain these deaths and generate awareness and policy change. After distinguishing the social autopsy from other means to explain excess and premature deaths, we delineate three core methodological principles of the social autopsy: social relevance as a guiding criterion to sample the deaths to be autopsied, embedding the patterning of deaths in social worlds, and a focus on contextual causality and social mechanisms. We provide three contemporary examples of excess deaths calling out for social autopsies: school shootings, Black deaths at the hands of police, and migrant border deaths.",

		"abstract": "In his account of the medical profession’s ascent, Paul Starr drew a distinction between the social authority of physicians and the cultural authority of medicine—between doctors’ capacity to direct others’ behavior and the ability of medical institutions and discourses to shape meanings of illness, health, wellness, and treatment. Subsequently, scholars have reflected on the social-structural transformations challenging physicians’ social authority but neglected shifts in cultural authority. Focusing on the United States, we find a proliferation and diversification of cultural authority, reflecting a partial movement from the domain of medicine into new terrains of health. This shift is apparent in the resurgence of alternative healing, the advent of new forms of self-care and self-monitoring, the rise of health social movements, and the spread of health information online. We advance a research agenda to understand how the mechanisms and dynamics of cultural authority shape contests to speak in the name of health.",

Major extrinsic factors (generally outside the control of the profession) include (1) the changing nature of the state and loss of its partisan support for doctoring, (2) the bureaucratization (corporatization) of doctoring; (3) the emerging competitive threat from other health care workers; (4) the consequences of globalization and the information revolution; (5) the epidemiologic transition and changes in the public conception of the body; and (6) changes in the doctor-patient relationship and the erosion of patient trust. Major intrinsic factors are (7) the weakening of physicians' labor market position through oversupply; and (8) the fragmentation or weakening of the physicians, union (AMA). Despite the recent sociopolitical transformation of modern U.S. medicine, our thinking remains wedded to a now inadequate theoretical approach. A future sociology of the professions can no longer overlook now pervasive macrostructural influences on provider behavior (corporate dominance). Until these influences are appropriately recognized and incorporated in social analyses, most policies designed to restore the professional ideal have little chance of success.",

I use the theories of Weber and Bourdieu to advance an alternative view of departmental prestige, which I show is an effect a department's position within networks of association and social exchange—that is, it is a form of social capital. The social network created by the exchange of PhDs among departments is the most important network of this kind. Using data on the exchange of PhDs among sociology departments, I apply network analysis to investigate this alternative conception of departmental prestige and to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional view. Within sociology, centrality within interdepartmental hiring networks explains 84 percent of the variance in departmental prestige. Similar findings are reported for history and political science. This alternative understanding of academic prestige helps clarify anomalies—e.g., the variance in prestige unconnected to scholarly productivity, the strong association between department size and prestige, and the long-term stability of prestige rankings—encountered in research that is based on the more conventional view.",

We compare the productivity of groups based on institution type, gender, academic rank, years of experience, and reputation of PhD-granting institution. Our age-cohort data suggest that differentials in productivity among institution types have diminished in recent decades. The top universities are losing ground, in relative terms, while faculty at other types of institutions are more productive now than in the past. Our results for gender are unlike those reported in previous research, revealing (1) higher productivity for women than for men across most institution types and (2) the absence of any gender differential for all institution types combined. Our data also show that book and article counts are virtually unrelated, that faculty at the top liberal arts colleges have the highest average book counts, and that there is great variation in productivity within every institution type. In general, associate professors, faculty with fewer than 17 years of experience, and faculty with doctorates from top universities are especially productive.",

We argue that these models provide advantages over conventional approaches due to their ability to account for inherent dependencies between individuals embedded in a social network (i.e., reciprocity, transitivity) and model interdependencies between network and behavioral dynamics. We provide a brief explanation of actor-oriented processes, followed by a description of parameter estimates, model specification, and selection procedures used by the Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analyses (SIENA) software program (Snijders, Steglich, Schweinberger, & Huisman, 2006). To illustrate the applicability of these models, we provide an empirical example investigating the co-evolution of friendship networks and delinquent behaviors in a longitudinal sample of Swedish adolescents with the goal of simultaneously assessing selection and influence processes. Findings suggest both processes play a substantive role in the observed dynamics of delinquent behaviors, with influence having a relatively stronger role than selection (especially in reciprocated friendships).",

		"abstract": "Stochastic actor-oriented (SAO) models are a family of models for network dynamics that enable researchers to test multiple, often competing explanations for network change and estimate the extent and relative power of various influences on network evolution. SAO models for the co-evolution of network ties and actor behavior, the most comprehensive category of SAO models, examine how networks and actor attributes—their behavior, performance, or attitudes—influence each other over time. While these models have been widely used in the social sciences, and particularly in educational settings, their use in organizational scholarship has been extremely limited. This paper provides a layperson introduction to SAO models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior and the types of research questions they can address. The models and their underpinnings are explained in nonmathematical terms, and theoretical explanations are supported by a concrete, detailed example that includes step-by-step model building and hypothesis testing, alongside an R script.",

		"abstract": "e23015\n            \n              Background: Interdisciplinary teams are an indispensable characteristic of modern organizations, particularly in healthcare settings that require specialists to work together to solve multifaceted patient care problems.\n              \n              Multidisciplinary tumor boards (TBs) aim to coordinate multidisciplinary perspectives to help the oncology team devise the best treatment program for the patient. Yet, while this is their purpose, studies have found that TBs do not always achieve that goal effectively. Why are some tumor board (TB) teams more effective than others? This study shed light on key characteristics found among highly effective TBs. It provides a theoretical explanation of their organizational behaviors and structures and their effect on cancer treatment decision-making. The research is grounded in organizational behavior theories that have historical prominence in group decision-making, social hierarchy, and interdisciplinary collaboration, and are used to explain the phenomenon under investigation best. Methods: Qualitative research was used in the study. Data from 44 different TB observations and 18 interviews were gathered over four years at seven research hospitals in the United States and United Kingdom. The data were then coded, analyzed and synthesized with organizational behavior theory to explain the social phenomena under investigation. Results: The study revealed that certain TBs practice strong collaboration displaying high levels of partnership, cooperation, equality, and interdependency, which was incorporated explicitly into their meeting systems to achieve their common goal. Team-based characteristics such as members’ consistent shared preferences and identity, coordinated interactions, a collective learning process, and shared power and partnership are key markers found within these teams that positively influenced treatment decision-making processes and outcomes, earmarking best practices in TB groups. Conclusions: Organizational theory that suggests that for a collaborative process to be effective, team-based mechanisms need to be adopted in which each member respects, trusts, and acknowledges the skills and expertise of other disciplines in the organization, shares team values, decision-making processes, responsibilities, and planning, relies mutually upon other team members, and works outside normal professional boundaries openly and willingly. In an egalitarian structure like that of the TBs reviewed in this study, where preferences and identities are consistent and groups are collaborative, treatment decisions are less biased and incorporate multidisciplinary perspectives. Thus, this study suggests that by possessing both team- and task-based characteristics and practices, TBs engage in best practices, and thereby optimize their functionality.",

The composition is variable, depending on the type of tumor discussed. As an organizational tool, MDTs are thought to optimize patient outcomes and to improve care performance. The aim of the study was to perform an umbrella review summarizing the available evidence on the impact of TBs on healthcare outcomes and processes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Pubmed and Web of Science databases were investigated along with a search through citations. The only study design included was systematic review. Only reviews published after 1997 concerning TBs and performed in hospital settings were considered. Two researchers synthetized the studies and assessed their quality through the AMSTAR2 tool.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Five systematic reviews published between 2008 and 2017 were retrieved. One review was focused on gastrointestinal cancers and included 16 studies; another one was centered on lung cancer and included 16 studies; the remaining three studies considered a wide range of tumors and included 27, 37 and 51 studies each. The main characteristics about format and members and the definition of TBs were collected. The decisions taken during TBs led to changes in diagnosis (probability to receive a more accurate assessment and staging), treatment (usually more appropriate) and survival (not unanimous improvement shown). Other outcomes less highlighted were quality of life, satisfaction and waiting times.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The study showed that the multidisciplinary approach is the best way to deliver the complex care needed by cancer patients; however, it is a challenge that requires organizational and cultural changes and must be led by competent health managers who can improve teamwork within their organizations. Further studies are needed to reinforce existing literature concerning health outcomes. Evidence on the impact of TBs on clinical practices is still lacking for many aspects of cancer care. Further studies should aim to evaluate the impact on survival rates, quality of life and patient satisfaction. Regular studies should be carried out and new process indicators should be defined to assess the impact and the performance of TBs more consistently.",

Responding to Hacking’s call for a Goffmanian mode of analysis to complement and balance the emphasis on large-scale transformations and discourses, we examine the narrative way in which clinicians provide evidence to support a diagnostic position. Using recordings and transcripts of clinical visits across two eras, our findings about the interaction order of the clinic show distinct story types and components that contribute to diagnostic narratives for ASD. These include stories about concrete “instantiations,” stories that propose “tendencies,” and “typifications” or generalizations regarding a specific child. This work contributes to interaction order theory, methodology, and other domains of social psychological research.",

Lack of support from senior colleagues, fear of criticism and a sense of perceived failure were linked to lower self-efficacy in end-of-life care. Beyond learning practical skills, physicians benefit from understanding the psychological factors impacting their experience and in building self-efficacy, and observing senior colleagues effectively process strong and difficult emotions.\n            \n            \n              Practical implications\n              Promoting personal reflection and sharing of the experiences encountered in end-of-life care, especially modelled from senior colleagues, may contribute to improvements in competence and reduce the impact of heroism, feelings of failure and avoidance in practice.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            As a society and as individuals, we have come to recognize ourselves as ‘death‐denying’, a self‐characterisation particularly prominent in palliative care discourse and practice. As part of a larger project examining death attitudes in the palliative care setting, a Medline search (1971 to 2001) was performed combining the text words ‘deny’ and ‘denial’ with the subject headings ‘terminal care’, ‘palliative care’ and ‘hospice care’. The 30 articles were analysed using a constant comparison technique and emerging themes regarding the meaning and usage of the words deny and denial were identified. This paper examines the theme of denial as an obstacle to palliative care. In the articles, denial was described as an impediment to open discussion of dying, dying at home, stopping ‘futile’ treatments, advance care planning and control of symptoms. I suggest that these components of care together constitute what has come to be perceived as a correct ‘way to die’. Indeed, the very conceptualisation of denial as an obstacle to these components of care has been integral to building and sustaining the ‘way to die’ itself. The personal struggle with mortality has become an important instrument in the public problem of managing the dying process.",

Despite significant sociological work on dying as a relational experience, there has been little exploration of the significance of contemporary family structures and relations. In this article, drawing on the accounts of twenty hospice in‐patients, we explore how the end of life (in this case within an in‐patient unit) is mediated by family dynamics and expectations. Participants’ accounts reveal a range of interpersonal experiences, including: pressures and strains on families\n              and\n              patients; differentiation in family responses to and involvement in the dying process; and tensions between individual and family preferences/desires. We argue that family dynamics strongly influence individual experiences near death and that the focus on individual preferences and the management of disease in palliative care contexts must be augmented with sophisticated and nuanced understandings of the family context. We suggest that sociological conceptual explanations of shifts in social and family life, such as individualisation and ontological security, may also help us better understand the ways families approach and respond to the dying process.",

Drawing on 1,500+ hours of observation in four intensive care units and 69 interviews with physicians and patients’ family members, I find inequality occurs through two mechanisms complementary to the cultural health capital and fundamental causes explanations prevalent in existing health disparities literature: in valuation, as the attitudes and values of the socially disadvantaged are challenged and ignored, and in standardization, as the outcomes preferred by less advantaged groups are defined as inappropriate and made harder to obtain by the informal and formal practices and policies of racialized organizations. I argue inequality is produced in part because wealthier and White elites shape institutional preferences and practices and, therefore, institutions and clinical standards to reflect their cultural tastes.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              The recent development of cancer precision medicine is associated with the emergence of ‘molecular tumour boards’ (\n              MTB\n              s). Attended by a heterogenous set of practitioners,\n              MTB\n              s link genomic platforms to clinical practices by establishing ‘actionable’ connections between drugs and molecular alterations. Their activities rely on a number of evidential resources – for example databases, clinical trial results, basic knowledge about mutations and pathways – that need to be associated with the clinical trajectory of individual patients. Experts from various domains are required to master and align diverse kinds of information. However, rather than examining\n              MTB\n              s as an institution interfacing different kinds of expertise embedded in individual experts, we argue that expertise is the emergent outcome of\n              MTB\n              s, which can be conceptualised as networks or ‘agencements’ of humans and devices. Based on the ethnographic analysis of the activities of four clinical trial\n              MTB\n              s (three in France and an international one) and of two French routine‐care\n              MTB\n              s, the paper analyses how\n              MTB\n              s produce therapeutic decisions, centring on the new kind of expertise they engender. The development and activities of\n              MTB\n              s signal a profound transformation of the evidentiary basis and processes upon which biomedical expertise and decision‐making in oncology are predicated and, in particular, the emergence of a\n              clinic of variants\n              .",

		"abstract": "From 1940 to 1980, studies of medical education were foundational to sociology, but attention shifted away from medical training in the late 1980s. Recently, there has been a marked return to this once pivotal topic, reflecting new questions and stakes. This article traces this resurgence by reviewing recent substantive research trends and setting the agenda for future research. We summarize four current research foci that reflect and critically map onto earlier projects in this subfield while driving theoretical development elsewhere in the larger discipline: (1) professional socialization, (2) knowledge regimes, (3) stratification within the profession, and (4) sociology of the field of medical education. We then offer six potential future directions where more research is needed: (1) inequalities in medical education, (2) socialization across the life course and new institutional forms of gatekeeping, (3) provider well-being, (4) globalization, (5) medical education as knowledge-based work, and (6) effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

		"abstract": "A pressing concern in contemporary health policy is whether the medical profession’s mandate to take care of clients has been undermined by the influx of money into health care. We examine the medical profession’s transformation over the past decades. First, we review how sociologists have viewed the medical profession over the past half-century as one stakeholder among other stakeholders vying for market share and power in the health care field.We then examine three recent challenges to the profession that exemplify the tension between self-interest and collective altruism to act in the best interest of patients: (1) the rise of patient consumerism, (2) the advent of evidence-based medicine, and (3) the increasing power of the pharmaceutical industry. We show the resilience of the medical profession as it adapts and transforms in response to these challenges. We conclude with implications to help inform policy makers’ assessments of how the medical profession will react to policy initiatives.",

Yet, despite a welter of case study data, sociologists of ideas have been slow to develop general theories for explaining why and how disciplines, subfields, theory groups, bandwagons, actor networks, and other kindred formations arise to alter the intellectual landscape. To fill this lacuna, this article presents a general theory of scientific/intellectual movements (SIMs). The theory synthesizes work in the sociology of ideas, social studies of science, and the literature on social movements to explain the dynamics of SIMs, which the authors take to be central mechanisms for change in the world of knowledge and ideas. Illustrating their arguments with a diverse sampling of positive and negative cases, they define SIMs, identify a set of theoretical presuppositions, and offer four general propositions for explaining the social conditions under which SIMs are most likely to emerge, gain prestige, and achieve some level of institutional stability.",

This paper presents empirical data from a study of professionals working with heart failure patients in the English National Health Service, focusing on the discourses employed by nurses and by three different specialties within medicine to legitimise their occupational boundaries. We identify four themes that characterise such discourses, specialised expertise, competence, organisational efficiency and patient‐centredness, though these are deployed to different degrees by the different professions. The findings point to a theory of ‘occupational legitimation talk’ in which newer occupations utilise a wider set of legitimacy claims as a means of strengthening their role and credibility within an increasingly complex and fluid healthcare environment.",

Although medical educators have discussed the best ways to teach these concepts for decades, there are still significant barriers to full incorporation of ‘the social’ into medical training.\n            \n            \n              Framework\n              Building upon previous scholarship in medical education, the author argues for the development in trainees of a ‘health professions education imagination’ or a unique ‘quality of mind’ that facilitates navigating competing ways of knowing. This concept borrows explicitly from ‘the sociological imagination’, which is briefly described. Next, some of the principles of thinking that might contribute to a similar ‘imagination’ in health professions education are identified. Finally, exemplars are provided highlighting how recent scholars have used their health professions education imaginations in recent research and teaching practice.\n            \n            \n              Implications\n              The health professions education imagination provides a useful framework to help guide clinical and research trainees to integrate the epistemologically diverse forms of knowledge they are exposed to and to break down the silos that these forms of knowledge are commonly taught within.\n            \n          , \n            The author describes the development of a \"quality of mind\" in health professions trainees challenged with navigating competing knowledge frameworks called the \"health professions education imagination\".",

		"abstract": "This study takes the well-established finding that sociology departments are ordered by a stable status hierarchy and investigates the relation of this hierarchy to the discipline's subfields. Using data drawn from the 2001 and 2020 editions of the American Sociological Association's \"Guide to Graduate Departments\", we show that subfields are not uniformly distributed across departments, but that certain subfields are over-represented in elite departments while others are concentrated in lower status institutions. Notably, we find that male dominated and theoretically oriented subfields are more highly represented at elite departments than those that are feminized or practically oriented. Longitudinal evidence suggests that this patterning has persisted for at least two decades without diminishing. We discuss potential advantages accrued to elite subfields, yet note that the most prestigious subfields are not the most prominent nor the best funded. Rather, we argue that status often sustains niche theoretical work despite limited popularity or practical application.",

		"abstract": "Doctors (and sociologists) have a long history of struggling to understand why patients seek medical help yet resist treatment recommendations. Explanations for resistance have pointed to macrostructural changes, such as the rise of the engaged patient or decline of physician authority. Rather than assuming that concepts such as resistance, authority, or engagement are exogenous phenomena transmitted via conversational conduits, we examine how they are dynamically co-constituted interactionally. Using conversation analysis to analyze a videotaped interaction of an oncology patient resisting the treatment recommendation even though she might die without treatment, we show how sustained resistance manifests in and through her doctor’s actions. This paradox, in which the doctor can both recommend life-prolonging care and condition resistance to it, has broad relevance beyond cancer treatment; it also can help us to understand other doctor–patient decisional conflicts, for instance, medication nonadherence, delaying emergent care, and vaccine refusal.",

		"abstract": "Our paper represents an attempt to stimulate continued sociological interest in professional work. Our review suggests that understanding professional work is central to understanding larger workplace changes in the late twentieth century. Some researchers have documented the increasingly diverse arrangements for the delivery of professional services, even as others point to a convergence of professional control around accountability and cost containment issues. Claims of diverging interests across work settings are often confounded by greater racial, gender, and ethnic diversity among professionals. We suggest that the study of professional careers provides an avenue for studying the diversification of professionals and work settings. Future research should also follow changes in the prestige rankings of different organizational arrangements from the viewpoint of professionals, professional associations, and clients. Finally we warn researchers that managerial groups seeking control of professional work have professional agendas of their own which constrain the possibilities for sweeping change.",

		"abstract": "The early leaders of the hospice movement shared a number of attitudes with the founders of the alternative institutions of the 1960s and early 1970s: nostalgia for simple, old fashioned ways, dissatisfaction with bureaucratic and authoritarian institutions, faith in the power of nature, a determination to avoid domination by experts, and a desire to improve the quality of personal relationships. However, as hospices have become better established, they gradually have been incorporated into the dominant health care system and have lost their uniqueness. Some have affiliated with hospitals or home health agencies. Even autonomous organizations are subject to pressures for accommodation because they rely on the established order for resources, personnel, and political acceptance. Organizations receiving payment under the new Medicare benefit must adhere to a set of regulations that may distort the movement. Though creation of this benefit may have been facilitated by increased support for hospice ideals, the government views hospices primarily as a way to save money. Paradoxically, as hospices have grown in popularity, the critical force of the movement has been blunted.",

		"abstract": "We use data from a 12-month ethnographic study of two medical-surgical units in a U.S. hospital to examine how members from different occupations can collaborate with one another in their daily work despite differences in status, shared meanings, and expertise across occupational groups, which previous work has shown to create difficulties. In our study, nurses and patient care technicians (PCTs) on both hospital units faced these same occupational differences, served the same patient population, worked under the same management and organizational structure, and had the same pressures, goals, and organizational collaboration tools available to them. But nurses and PCTs on one unit successfully collaborated while those on the other did not. We demonstrate that a social structure characterized by cross-cutting demographics between occupational groups—in which occupational membership is uncorrelated with demographic group membership—can loosen attachment to the occupational identity and status order. This allows members of cross-occupational dyads, in our case nurses and PCTs, to draw on other shared social identities, such as shared race, age, or immigration status, in their interactions. Drawing on a shared social identity at the dyad level provided members with a “dyadic toolkit” of alternative, non-occupational expertise, shared meanings, status rules, and emotional scripts that facilitated collaboration across occupational differences and improved patient care.",

Using institutionalist lenses in professional settings, we highlight the relationship between professionalization and broader institutionalization projects. We start by critically reviewing existing approaches in the sociology of the professions, identifying a functionalist and a conflict‐based approach. Then, we build on and further elaborate an institutionalist perspective on professional work. Such a perspective affirms the importance of studying professions as institutions and connecting professionalization to broader patterns of institutionalization; it highlights the role of professions and professionals as agents in the creation, maintenance, and disruption of institutions, and recognizes the importance of accommodating contemporary patterns of professionalization within the organizational context. We also illustrate how, empirically, the eight papers in this issue advance our understanding of professional agency in contemporary change and, theoretically, contribute to the reconceptualization of the study of professionalism. Finally, we briefly summarize our contribution and identify a series of directions for further research.",

		"abstract": "The physician–patient relationship has evolved significantly in the past century. Physician authority has been reduced while patients have been empowered. This review focuses on face-to-face clinical care and argues that current physician–patient relations range from partnerships between social actors who each play critical roles in negotiating care to a more adversarial duel in which both participants advocate for goals that are not necessarily shared. While the former is the hope of increased patient involvement, the latter is increasingly common. Through our discussion of existing studies, we document that while high levels of patient participation are beneficial to treatment outcomes, this engagement also has a dark side that threatens treatment outcomes. We discuss some communication resources patients use that affect treatment outcomes, exemplify how patient engagement affects physician communication, and discuss some strategies that current research finds effective for communicating about treatment with today's engaged patients.",

We compare Finnish data to similar international data and discuss their content with regard to the literature. We analysed the types of electronic health record–related patient safety incidents that occurred at 23 hospitals during a 2-year period. A procedure of taxonomy mapping served to allow comparisons. This study represents a rare examination of patient safety risks in a fully digital environment. The proportion of electronic health record–related incidents was markedly higher in our study than in previous studies with similar data. Human–computer interaction problems were the most frequently reported. The results show the possibility of error arising from the complex interaction between clinicians and computers.",

It is the purpose of this act to ensure that a patient's right to self-determination in health care decisions be communicated and protected. Through advance directives--the living will and the durable power of attorney--the right to accept or reject medical or surgical treatment is available to adults while competent, so that in the event that such adults become incompetent to make decisions, they would more easily continue to control decisions affecting their health care. Without advance directives and the proper adherence to such directives, former President Richard Nixon and former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis might still be alive today, in persistent vegetative states. This article examines the history of the act, its importance to each individual, the clinical, ethical and legal issues, and the role of health care professionals in effectively implementing and ensuring compliance of the PSDA.",

Only in recent times has the notion arisen that our primary goal is to identify and cure diseases, thereby prolonging life and, presumably, preventing distressing symptoms and associated suffering. The medical advances made in recent decades are indeed so astonishing that one could almost forgive those who would hope that a cure-based medical system might eliminate scourges such as pain, chronic illness, and the debilitations of old age. However, we remain mortal. I recall a scene from Bernado Bertolucci's film Little Buddha in which a child sits with a wise, old monk looking out over a bustling city in Nepal. \"What is impermanence?\" asks the child. The monk answers, \"See these people. All of us and all the people alive today. One hundred years from now we'll all be dead. That is impermanence.\" Intellectually, I understand the truth of this statement. However that more than 6 billion people will die in a period of 100 years is beyond my comprehension\"--",

		"abstract": "The practice of surgical palliative care is not new. Dr Balfour M. M. Mount, a retired urologic surgeon is considered the father of North American Palliative Care and coined the term Palliative Care in 1975. Dr Geoffrey P. Dunn, a retired general surgeon and hospice and palliative medicine specialist along with other like minded surgical colleagues were instrumental in developing the field of surgical palliative care. Dr Olga Jonasson, championed the American Board of Surgery becoming one of the sponsoring boards of the Hospice and Palliative Medicine certifying exam. Dr Anne Mosenthal advocated for palliative care to be integrated as parallel clinical aims so espoused in the Trauma Quality and Improvement Program Palliative Care Best Practice Guidelines. Dr Mosenthal currently chairs the American College of Surgeons Committee on Surgical Palliative Care. This introductory article is a brief history about the origins of surgical palliative care and sheds light on the current landscape of surgeons integrating primary and specialty palliative care into surgical practice. The aim of this surgical palliative care symposium is to take everyday surgical problems and highlight the application and benefit of palliative care when treating surgical patients with serious illness. Integrating palliative care principles into standard clinical management is evidenced based patient-centered practice.",

		"abstract": "Boundary-work is constitutive of both jurisdiction and professional identities. For groups attempting domain expansion, changed boundaries present risks for group cohesion. In this article, I examine the boundary-work that nurse-practitioners-in-training perform to negotiate the contradictions of moving into the new terrain of diagnostic medicine. I found that students engaged in reparative boundary-work that re-inscribed the new terrain of the nurse practitioner into the “old work” of bedside nursing. These strategies not only resolved the contradictions of nurse practitioner identity, but they also provided strategies of action for negotiating new relationships with future physician colleagues. This analysis demonstrates that the defense of breached boundaries is activated not only by external threats but also by the internal threats of jurisdictional expansion.",

		"abstract": "In this comparative ethnographic case study of the implementation of a reform related to the Affordable Care Act in two community health centers, I find that professionals may not compete to claim new tasks (and thereby not implement reform) if these tasks require them to acquire information unrelated to their professional expertise, use work practices that conflict with their professional identity, or do impure or low-value tasks that threaten their professional interests. In such cases, reform may be implemented if lower-status workers fill in the gaps in the division of labor between the professions targeted by the reform, playing a brokerage role by protecting each profession’s information, meanings, and tasks in everyday work. When the new tasks represent professionally ill-defined problems, brokers can be more effective if they use buffering practices rather than connecting practices—managing information rather than transferring it, matching meanings rather than translating them, and maintaining interests rather than transforming them—to accomplish reform. By playing a buffering role in the interstices between existing professional jurisdictions, lower-status workers can carve out their own jurisdiction, becoming a brokerage profession between existing professions that need to collaborate with one another for reform to occur.",

		"abstract": "\"How the authority of medicine is continuously shaped by relationships among physicians, industry, colleagues, and organizations Exploring how the authority of medicine is controlled, negotiated, and organized, Managing Medical Authority asks: How is knowledge shared throughout the profession? Who makes decisions when your heart malfunctions-physicians, hospital administrators, or private companies who sell pacemakers? How do physicians gain and keep their influence? Arguing that medicine's authority is managed in collegial competition across venues, Daniel Menchik examines the full range of stakeholders driving the direction of the field: medical trainees, clinicians, researchers, administrators, and even the corporations that develop groundbreaking technologies enabling longer and better lives.Menchik takes us into Superior Hospital to witness surgeries and executive negotiations. He moves outside the hospital to watch professional committees craft standards for treatments, case management, and professional ethics. At industry-sponsored meetings, he observes company representatives who train some experienced doctors on their technologies, while deterring others who they think might injure patients. Using an innovative ethnographic approach tying individual actions and their collective consequences, he considers how stakeholders ally across the various venues of medicine, even as they are sometimes pressed into competition within those venues. Menchik finds that these alliances and rivalries strengthen the authority of medicine as a whole. From place to place, and group to group, we see how a medical specialty renews and reinvigorates itself.Beginning within the walls of the hospital, and moving to the professional and commercial venues that shape it, Managing Medical Authority offers an agenda-setting take on the social organization of medical authority\"--",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            Open science practices such as posting data or code and pre-registering analyses are increasingly prescribed and debated in the applied sciences, but the actual popularity and lifetime usage of these practices remain unknown. This study provides an assessment of attitudes toward, use of, and perceived norms regarding open science practices from a sample of authors published in top-10 (most-cited) journals and PhD students in top-20 ranked North American departments from four major social science disciplines: economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. We observe largely favorable private attitudes toward widespread lifetime usage (meaning that a researcher has used a particular practice at least once) of open science practices. As of 2020, nearly 90% of scholars had ever used at least one such practice. Support for posting data or code online is higher (88% overall support and nearly at the ceiling in some fields) than support for pre-registration (58% overall). With respect to norms, there is evidence that the scholars in our sample appear to underestimate the use of open science practices in their field. We also document that the reported lifetime prevalence of open science practices increased from 49% in 2010 to 87% a decade later.",

We argue that much of this coherence can be lost when decision makers adopt multinational strategic guidance that is then interpreted by different national contingents operationally. Different strategic and military cultures across troop-contributing countries may account for observed variation in operational outcomes, but better theoretical tools are needed to examine this phenomenon. Our aim is to further scholars’ understanding of how cultural variables can affect mission outcomes. This assumed effect of strategic and military cultures is explored empirically with reference to the Canadian and German Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan, which formed part of the NATO-led ISAF operation.",

		"abstract": "The paper examines managing knowledge across boundaries in settings where innovation is desired. Innovation is a useful context because it allows us to explore the negative consequences of the path-dependent nature of knowledge. A framework is developed that describes three progressively complex boundaries—syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic—and three progressively complex processes—transfer, translation, and transformation. The framework is used to specify the practical and political mismatches that occur when innovation is desired and how this relates to the common knowledge that actors use to share and assess each other's domain-specific knowledge. The development and use of a collaborative engineering tool in the early stages of a vehicle's development is presented to illustrate the conceptual and prescriptive value of the framework. The implication of this framework on key topics in the organization theory and strategy literatures is then discussed.",

This article examines the reflexive and recursive relation of time and talk in the constitution of organizations. It suggests that organizational work is paced and positioned through a variety of `temporal frames'; these, in turn, are achieved in and through the quick exchanges and extended meetings that make up the business of talk. They provide ways of filtering past practice into present agendas that are both pragmatic and adaptive. Organizations are made to `tick' through talk.",

While this is commonplace, the rationale for, and limits of, using pseudonyms or other methods to disguise identifying information are seldom explained in empirical works. Following an illustrated outline of pseudonyms, epithets, codenames and other obscurant techniques used in the social sciences and humanities, this paper considers how they variously frame the identities of, and position the relations between, participants and researchers. It suggests ways in which researchers might improve on current practice.",

Yet many important decisions must be made in complex, ambiguous clinical situations in which all possible options cannot be known, evidence is inadequate to inform patients’ preferences fully, and/or patients are unclear about their desired level of involvement. In these situations, preferences are shaped by affect, framing, and “collaborative cognition” among clinicians, patients, and their families; thus, decisions are often relational, dynamic, iterative, provisional, and/or conditional. Clinicians can help patients achieve greater autonomy by engaging both intuitive and deliberative decision-making processes (“whole mind”) and involving others in exploring, clarifying, and co-constructing patients’ preferences (“shared mind”). Clinical and interpersonal relationships can promote effective decision making through developing a shared attentional focus, tailoring information, and identifying conditions under which provisional preferences might change. Information technology and health systems offer untapped potential to deepen the relationships and conversations within which decisions are made.",

This article offers a description of the nature and causes of suffering in patients undergoing medical treatment. A distinction based on clinical observations is made between suffering and physical distress. Suffering is experienced by persons, not merely by bodies, and has its source in challenges that threaten the intactness of the person as a complex social and psychological entity. Suffering can include physical pain but is by no means limited to it. The relief of suffering and the cure of disease must be seen as twin obligations of a medical profession that is truly dedicated to the care of the sick. Physicians' failure to understand the nature of suffering can result in medical intervention that (though technically adequate) not only fails to relieve suffering but becomes a source of suffering itself.",

		"abstract": "In 2008, five ‘serious untoward incidents’ occurred on a small maternity unit in a hospital in the UK. The prevailing view, held by clinical staff, hospital managers, and executives, was that these events were unconnected and did not signal systemic failures in care. This view was maintained by the testimony of staff and governance procedures which prevented the incidents from being considered together. Drawing on the inquiry report of the Morecambe Bay Investigation (2015), I examine how the prevailing view was built and dismantled, eventually being replaced with a very different description of events. Overturning this view required affected parents to engage with governing bodies and legal processes, challenge clinical staff, lobby for inquests, and mobilise social media and the national press. Tracing how different descriptions of events weaken or gather force as they travel through different forums, processes, and are presented to different audiences, I explore the sociology of knowledge around establishing failures of care.",

This article uses conversation analysis to explore this balance in relation to patient disclosures of medical misdeeds in video-recorded primary care medical visits (e.g., taking another’s prescription medication or failing to adhere to a healthy lifestyle or prescription regimen). We focus on patient-initiated disclosures. We show that disclosures are used (1) where patients are seeking physician assessment of their behavior, (2) where patients are proposing the etiology of a health problem, and (3) where patients are lobbying for a particular treatment outcome. We argue that disclosures of medical misdeeds are an important but understudied domain of conduct in which patients show awareness of their own agency over, and responsibility for, their healthcare and respect for the physician’s medical authority.",

We compare economic models of reputation that emphasize the role of past quality as a source of information about current quality with sociological models of status that emphasize the role of affiliations. We test hypotheses about the complementary effects of status and reputation in an analysis of more than 10,000 affiliation decisions made by 595 wineries over a 10-year period. Results show that actors occupying high-status positions obtain greater benefit from subsequent high-status affiliations than do actors occupying low-status positions. As such, these actors are more willing and able to pay for subsequent high-status affiliations and to use them to advance their position in the larger status ordering.",

We propose that, faced with great uncertainty about the quality of young companies, third parties rely on the prominence of the affiliates of those companies to make judgments about their quality and that young companies “endorsed” by prominent exchange partners will perform better than otherwise comparable ventures that lack prominent associates. Results of an empirical examination of the rate of initial public offering (IPO) and the market capitalization at IPO of the members of a large sample of venture-capital-backed biotechnology firms show that privately held biotech firms with prominent strategic alliance partners and organizational equity investors go to IPO faster and earn greater valuations at IPO than firms that lack such connections. We also empirically demonstrate that much of the benefit of having prominent affiliates stems from the transfer of status that is an inherent byproduct of interorganizational associations.",

However, the ways in which academics as a professional group organize themselves towards common objectives that possibly transcend systems, institutions and disciplines, has not been explored so far. Therefore, the goal of this article is investigate how academics organize themselves in the pursuit of their professional, scientific and scholarly interests outside the university setting and across national higher education systems. We address this question by studying European academic associations. Drawing from World Polity Theory, studies on Professions and Professionalism, as well as on Interest Groups, we derive expectations as to the growth in number of academic associations and their aims. Based on the analysis of 324 associations, our findings show that assuming that the founding of academic associations is related primarily to the emergence or presence of international organizations needs to be revisited, as foundations appear to be affected by other contingent events as well. As to their aims, there is more variety than usually posited and five types of academic associations can be identified. We discuss the implications of on-going European integration in higher education and research from theory and policy perspectives.",

		"abstract": "Introduction:\n              Patients with incurable cancer have poor prognostic awareness. We present a detailed analysis of the dialogue between oncologists and patients in conversations with prognostic implications.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              A total of 128 audio-recorded encounters from a large multisite trial were obtained, and 64 involved scan results. We used conversation analysis, a qualitative method for studying human interaction, to analyze typical patterns and conversational devices.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Four components consistently occurred in sequential order: symptom-talk, scan-talk, treatment-talk, and logistic-talk. Six of the encounters (19%) were identified as good news, 15 (45%) as stable news, and 12 (36%) as bad news. The visit duration varied by the type of news: good, 15 minutes (07:00-29:00); stable, 17 minutes (07:00-41:00); and bad, 20 minutes (07:00-28:00). Conversational devices were common, appearing in half of recordings. Treatment-talk occupied 50% of bad-news encounters, 31% of good-news encounters, and 19% of stable-news encounters. Scan-talk occupied less than 10% of all conversations. There were only four instances of frank prognosis discussion.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              Oncologists and patients are complicit in constructing the typical encounter. Oncologists spend little time discussing scan results and the prognostic implications in favor of treatment-related talk. Conversational devices routinely help transition from scan-talk to detailed discussions about treatment options. We observed an opportunity to create prognosis-talk after scan-talk with a new conversational device, the question “Would you like to talk about what this means?” as the oncologist seeks permission to disclose prognostic information while ceding control to the patient.",

There has been a shift away from what Talcott Parsons described as a paternalistic model of interaction to a more collaborative, participatory, patient-centered model of interaction. Yet not all interactions between doctors and patients are collaborative. Using status characteristics theory, the authors hypothesized that medical encounters are more likely to be physician dominated when the status differences between doctors and patients are higher. They tested hypotheses about race, gender, and socioeconomic status differences between doctors and patients. The authors found support for the hypotheses, especially regarding status differences for race and gender. Doctor-patient interactions were most physician-centered when doctors had higher status than patients on race (white versus non-white) and gender (male versus female)",

		"abstract": "This article investigates the way in which physicians or clinicians apparently advance their professional dominance by ignoring lifeworld concerns of the patients of clients they see. Usual analyses of this phenomenon invoke conceptions of authority to explain it implicitly, or they propose that the asymmetry of clinical discourse relies solely on an institutional basis. In order to discover and analyze interactional aspects of the clinical encounter, comparative studies between institutional and everyday contexts are necessary. This article demonstrates that, through the use of a conversational \"perspective display series,\" which is adapted to the clinical environment, a delivery of \"bad\" diagnosis news can coimplicate the patient's perspective and promote understanding and the appearance of agreement between clinician and patient. In general, describing manifestations of institutional power and authority should include analysis of the ways that participants organize interaction in the first place.",

		"abstract": "In this article, I propose and define the new concept of cultural health capital, based on cultural capital theories, to help account for how patient-provider interactions unfold in ways that may generate disparities in health care. I define cultural health capital as the repertoire of cultural skills, verbal and nonverbal competencies, attitudes and behaviors, and interactional styles, cultivated by patients and clinicians alike, that, when deployed, may result in more optimal health care relationships. I consider cultural health capital alongside existing frameworks for understanding clinical interactions, and I argue that the concept of cultural health capital offers theoretical traction to help account for several dynamics of unequal treatment. These dynamics include the often nonpurposeful, habitual nature of culturally-mediated interactional styles; their growing importance amidst sociocultural changes in U.S. health care; their direct and indirect effects as instrumental as well as symbolic forms of capital; and their ability to account for the systematic yet variable relationship between social status and health care interactions.",

Advanced cancer, highly prevalent and morbid, presents with worsening symptoms, heightening the need for supportive and EOL care.\n            \n            \n              Purpose:\n              To conduct a systematic review examining ethnic/racial disparities in EOL care for cancer patients.\n            \n            \n              Design:\n              We searched four electronic databases for all original research examining EOL care use, preferences, and beliefs for cancer patients from ethnic/racial minority groups.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Twenty-five studies were included: 20 quantitative and five qualitative. All had a full-text English language article and focused on the ethnic/racial minority groups of African Americans, Hispanics Americans, or Asian Americans. Key themes included EOL decision making processes, family involvement, provider communication, religion and spirituality, and patient preferences. Hospice was the most studied EOL care, and was most used among Whites, followed by use among Hispanics, and least used by African and Asian Americans. African Americans perceived a greater need for hospice, yet more frequently had inadequate knowledge. African Americans preferred aggressive treatment, yet EOL care provided was often inconsistent with preferences. Hispanics and African Americans less often documented advance care plans, citing religious coping and spirituality as factors.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              EOL care differences among ethnic/racial minority cancer patients were found in the processes, preferences, and beliefs regarding their care. Further steps are needed to explore the exact causes of differences, yet possible explanations include religious or cultural differences, caregiver respect for patient autonomy, access barriers, and knowledge of EOL care options.",

Little research has used critical, race-conscious approaches to examine factors associated with these outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              To investigate the lived experiences of Black patients with serious illness and how various factors may be associated with patient-clinician communication and medical decision-making.\n            \n            \n              Design, Setting, and Participants\n              In this qualitative study, one-on-one, semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 Black patients with serious illness hospitalized at an urban academic medical center in Washington State between January 2021 and February 2023. Patients were asked to discuss experiences with racism, how those experiences affected the way they communicated with clinicians, and how racism impacted medical decision-making. Public Health Critical Race Praxis was used as framework and process.\n            \n            \n              Main Outcomes and Measures\n              The experience and of racism and its association, as described by Black patients who had serious illness, with patient-clinician communication and medical decision-making within a racialized health care setting.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 25 Black patients (mean [SD] age, 62.0 [10.3] years; 20 males [80.0%]) with serious illness were interviewed. Participants had substantial socioeconomic disadvantage, with low levels of wealth (10 patients with 0 assets [40.0%]), income (annual income &amp;lt;$25 000 among 19 of 24 patients with income data [79.2%]), educational attainment (mean [SD] 13.4 [2.7] years of schooling), and health literacy (mean [SD] score in the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine–Short Form, 5.8 [2.0]). Participants reported high levels of medical mistrust and high frequency of discrimination and microaggressions experienced in health care settings. Participants reported epistemic injustice as the most common manifestation of racism: silencing of their own knowledge and lived experiences about their bodies and illness by health care workers. Participants reported that these experiences made them feel isolated and devalued, especially if they had intersecting, marginalized identities, such as being underinsured or unhoused. These experiences were associated with exacerbation of existing medical mistrust and poor patient-clinician communication. Participants described various mechanisms of self-advocacy and medical decision-making based on prior experiences with mistreatment from health care workers and medical trauma.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions and Relevance\n              This study found that Black patients’ experiences with racism, specifically epistemic injustice, were associated with their perspectives on medical care and decision-making during serious illness and end of life. These findings suggest that race-conscious, intersectional approaches may be needed to improve patient-clinician communication and support Black patients with serious illness to alleviate the distress and trauma of racism as these patients near the end of life.",

However, available data points to significant barriers to palliative and end-of-life care among minority adults. The main objective of this scoping review was to summarize the current published research and literature on disparities in palliative and hospice care and completion of advance care planning and directives among non-Hispanc Blacks.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              The scoping review method was used because currently published research in disparities in palliative and hospice cares as well as advance care planning are limited. Nine electronic databases and websites were searched to identify English-language peer-reviewed publications published within last 20 years. A total of 147 studies that addressed palliative care, hospice care, and advance care planning and included non-Hispanic Blacks were incorporated in this study. The literature review include manuscripts that discuss the intersection of social determinants of health and end-of-life care for non-Hispanic Blacks. We examined the potential role and impact of several factors, including knowledge regarding palliative and hospice care; healthcare literacy; communication with providers and family; perceived or experienced discrimination with healthcare systems; mistrust in healthcare providers; health care coverage, religious-related activities and beliefs on palliative and hospice care utilization and completion of advance directives among non-Hispanic Blacks.\n            \n            \n              Discussion:\n              Cross-sectional and longitudinal national surveys, as well as local community- and clinic-based data, unequivocally point to major disparities in palliative and hospice care in the United States. Results suggest that national and community-based, multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary, theoretical-based, resourceful, culturally-sensitive interventions are urgently needed. A number of practical investigational interventions are offered. Additionally, we identify several research questions which need to be addressed in future research.",

To improve equitable patient-centered end-of-life care, we examine barriers and facilitators to ACP among clinicians as they are central participants in these discussions.\n            \n            \n              Method\n              In this national study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with purposively selected clinicians from 6 diverse health systems between August 2018 and June 2019. Thematic analysis yielded themes characterizing clinicians’ perceptions of barriers and facilitators to ACP among patients, and patient-centered ways of overcoming them.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Among 74 participants, 49 (66.2%) were physicians, 16.2% were nurses, and 13.5% were social workers. Most worked in primary care (35.1%), geriatrics (21.1%), and palliative care (19.3%) settings. Clinicians most frequently expressed difficulty discussing ACP with certain racial and ethnic groups (African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American) (31.1%), non-native English speakers (24.3%), and those with certain religious beliefs (Catholic, Orthodox Jewish, and Muslim) (13.5%). Clinicians were more likely to attribute barriers to ACP completion to patients (62.2%), than to clinicians (35.1%) or health systems (37.8%). Three themes characterized clinicians’ difficulty approaching ACP (preconceived views of patients’ preferences, narrow definitions of successful ACP, and lack of institutional resources), while the final theme illustrated facilitators to ACP (acknowledging bias and rejecting stereotypes, mission-driven focus on ACP, and acceptance of all preferences).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Most clinicians avoided ACP with certain racial and ethnic groups, those with limited English fluency, and persons with certain religious beliefs. Our findings provide evidence to support development of clinician-level and institutional-level interventions and to reduce disparities in ACP.",

Research into this field of inquiry raises unique theoretical, methodological, and moral issues. Without the critical reflection of methods of study and reporting of findings, researchers may inadvertently compromise their contribution to reducing injustices and perpetuating racism.\n            \n            \n              Aim:\n              To examine key evidence of the place of minoritised communities in palliative care research to devise recommendations that improve the precision and rigour of research and reporting of findings.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              Narrative review of articles identified from PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar for 10 years augmented with supplementary searches.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              We identified and appraised 109 relevant articles.

Palliative care research must be forthright in explicitly indentifying instances of structural and systemic racism in palliative care research and engaging in non-judgemental debate on changes required.",

Although these disparities are widely known, there is a marked lack of empirical evidence. The authors conducted a systematic scoping review that synthesized the literature since 2000 about racial and ethnic disparities in palliative and end-of-life care. We searched PubMed, Medline, SocIndex, CINAHL, Social Work Abstracts, and PsycINFO, using search terms including palliative care or end-of-life care, disparities or barriers or utilization, and race or ethnicity or African American or Hispanic. Findings lend support to extant literature that social-environmental barriers and disparities distinctly affect access to care for these populations. The review expands upon understanding of how social determinants drive disparities in palliative and end-of-life care and suggests implications for practice, policy, and research in promoting health equity in serious illness.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\n              Inpatient palliative care consultation (IPCC) may help address barriers that limit the use of hospice and the receipt of symptom-focused care for racial/ethnic minorities, yet little is known about disparities in the rates of IPCC. We evaluated the association between race/ethnicity and rates of IPCC for patients with advanced cancer.\n            \n            \n              Patients and Methods\n              Patients with metastatic cancer who were hospitalized between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, at an urban academic medical center participated in the study. Patient-level multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and IPCC.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 6,288 patients (69% non-Hispanic white, 19% African American, and 6% Hispanic) were eligible. Of these patients, 16% of whites, 22% of African Americans, and 20% of Hispanics had an IPCC (overall P < .001). Compared with whites, African Americans had a greater likelihood of receiving an IPCC (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.44), even after adjusting for insurance, hospitalizations, marital status, and illness severity. Among patients who received an IPCC, African Americans had a higher median number of days from IPCC to death compared with whites (25 v 17 days; P = .006), and were more likely than Hispanics (59% v 41%; P = .006), but not whites, to be referred to hospice.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Inpatient settings may neutralize some racial/ethnic differences in access to hospice and palliative care services; however, irrespective of race/ethnicity, rates of IPCC remain low and occur close to death. Additional research is needed to identify interventions to improve access to palliative care in the hospital for all patients with advanced cancer.",

		"abstract": "Status has become an increasingly influential concept in the fields of organizational and economic sociology during the past two decades. Research in this area has not only helped explain behavior within and between organizations, but has also contributed to our understanding of status processes more generally. In this review, we point to the contributions of this field in terms of the determinants of status, the effects of status, and the mechanisms by which these effects are produced. We next appraise the way in which a network approach has contributed to our formal understanding of status positions and status hierarchies. We then highlight recent studies that demonstrate the value of studying the structures of status hierarchies themselves rather than focusing solely on the actors within them. After suggesting potential directions for future research, we conclude by calling for renewed efforts to translate concepts and theories across levels of analysis and substantive commitment in order to build more general theories of status processes.",

		"abstract": "Although opening up of research is considered an appropriate and trend-setting model for future scientific communication, it can still be difficult to put open science into practice. How open and transparent can a scientific work be? This article investigates the potential to make all information and the whole work process of a qualification project such as a doctoral thesis comprehensively and freely accessible on the internet with an open free license both in the final form and completely traceable in development. The answer to the initial question, the self-experiment and the associated demand for openness, posed several challenges for a doctoral student, the institution, and the examination regulations, which are still based on the publication of an individually written and completed work that cannot be viewed by the public during the creation process. In the case of data and other documents, publication is usually not planned even after completion. This state of affairs in the use of open science in the humanities will be compared with open science best practices in the physical sciences. The reasons and influencing factors for open developments in science and research are presented, empirically and experimentally tested in the development of the first completely open humanities-based PhD thesis. The results of this two-part study show that it is possible to publish everything related to the doctoral study, qualification, and research process as soon as possible, as comprehensively as possible, and under an open license.",

		"abstract": "Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. The tendency of psychological science to avoid publishing null results produces a situation that limits the replicability assumption of science, as replication cannot be meaningful without the potential acknowledgment of failed replications. We argue that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.",

The two create tension between divergent viewpoints and the need for generalizable findings. We present a model of how one group of actors managed this tension. It draws on the work of amateurs, professionals, administrators and others connected to the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, during its early years. Extending the Latour-Callon model of interessement, two major activities are central for translating between viewpoints: standardization of methods, and the development of `boundary objects'. Boundary objects are both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust enough to maintain identity across them. We distinguish four types of boundary objects: repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms.",

The book is based on field work done by Bruno Latour in Roger Guillemin's laboratory at the Salk Institute and provides an important link between the sociology of modern sciences and laboratory studies in the history of science",

Reversals of preference are demonstrated in choices regarding monetary outcomes, both hypothetical and real, and in questions pertaining to the loss of human lives. The effects of frames on preferences are compared to the effects of perspectives on perceptual appearance. The dependence of preferences on the formulation of decision problems is a significant concern for the theory of rational choice.",

		"abstract": "Researchers have reported that, for individual workers, low job control is associated with high burnout; however, as yet it is unclear whether this association holds for occupations as well. Whether differences in job control between occupations as assessed by eight expert judges could account for individual-level and occupational-level differences in burnout rates. Data were obtained from 9,503 incumbents of 28 occupations in The Netherlands ( M age = 37.9 yr., SD = 8.7; 50% were men). Burnout was measured on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Occupational-level job control was inversely correlated with burnout, explaining 16% of the variation in occupational-level burnout. Thus, between-occupation differences in job control are somewhat systematically related to burnout.",

		"abstract": "Context \n              Given the trend among medical students away from primary care medicine and toward specialties that allow for more controllable lifestyles, the identification of factors associated with specialty choice is important. Burnout is one such factor. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between burnout and residency specialty choice in terms of provision for a less versus more controllable lifestyle (e.g. internal medicine versus dermatology) and a lower versus higher income (e.g. paediatrics versus anaesthesiology).\n            \n            \n              Methods \n              A survey was sent to 165 Year 4 medical students who had entered the residency matching system. Students answered questions about specialty choice, motivating factors (lifestyle, patient care and prestige) and perceptions of medicine as a profession. They completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory–Human Services (MBI), which defines burnout in relation to emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalisation (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). Burnout and other variables were tested for associations with specialty lifestyle controllability and income.\n            \n            \n              Results \n              A response rate of 88% (\n              n\n               = 145) was achieved. Experiences of MBI‐EE, MBI‐DP and MBI‐PA burnout were reported by 42 (29%), 26 (18%) and 30 (21%) students, respectively. Specialties with less controllable lifestyles were chosen by 87 (60%) students and lower‐income specialties by 81 (56%). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) indicated that the choice of a specialty with a more controllable lifestyle was associated with higher MBI‐EE burnout (OR = 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–2.96), as well as stronger lifestyle‐ and prestige‐related motivation, and weaker patient care‐related motivation. The choice of a higher‐income specialty was associated with lower MBI‐PA burnout (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.32–0.98), weaker lifestyle‐ and patient care‐related motivation, and stronger prestige‐related motivation.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions \n              Specialty choices regarding lifestyle controllability and income were associated with the amount and type of medical school burnout, as well as with lifestyle‐, prestige‐ and patient care‐related motivation. Given that burnout may influence specialty choice, particularly with regard to the primary care specialties, medical schools may consider the utility of burnout prevention strategies.\n            \n          , \n            \n              Discuss ideas arising from this article at ‘\n              discuss\n              ’",

We survey more than 60 years of advances in understanding satisficing in economics, psychology, and management, identifying two research traditions that address two classes of situations: under risk, satisficing is typically inferior to optimization strategies and modeled according to the neoclassical framework; under uncertainty, satisficing strategies are often derived empirically and can be highly effective. We integrate the two research traditions and show the conditions under which satisficing can be rational. (JEL D11, D80, D90)",

		"abstract": "Aims and objectives. \n              The aim of this paper was to review the current literature clinical decision‐making models and the educational application of models to clinical practice. This was achieved by exploring the function and related research of the three available models of clinical decision making: information‐processing model, the intuitive‐humanist model and the clinical decision‐making model.\n            \n            \n              Background. \n              Clinical decision making is a unique process that involves the interplay between knowledge of pre‐existing pathological conditions, explicit patient information, nursing care and experiential learning. Historically, two models of clinical decision making are recognized from the literature; the information‐processing model and the intuitive‐humanist model. The usefulness and application of both models has been examined in relation the provision of nursing care and care related outcomes. More recently a third model of clinical decision making has been proposed. This new multidimensional model contains elements of the information‐processing model but also examines patient specific elements that are necessary for cue and pattern recognition.\n            \n            \n              Design. \n              Literature review.\n            \n            \n              Methods. \n              Evaluation of the literature generated from MEDLINE, CINAHL, OVID, PUBMED and EBESCO systems and the Internet from 1980 to November 2005.\n            \n            \n              Results. \n              The characteristics of the three models of decision making were identified and the related research discussed.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions. \n              Three approaches to clinical decision making were identified, each having its own attributes and uses. The most recent addition to the clinical decision making is a theoretical, multidimensional model which was developed through an evaluation of current literature and the assessment of a limited number of research studies that focused on the clinical decision‐making skills of inexperienced nurses in pseudoclinical settings. The components of this model and the relative merits to clinical practice are discussed.\n            \n            \n              Relevance to clinical practice. \n              It is proposed that clinical decision making improves as the nurse gains experience of nursing patients within a specific speciality and with experience, nurses gain a sense of saliency in relation to decision making. Experienced nurses may use all three forms of clinical decision making both independently and concurrently to solve nursing‐related problems. It is suggested that O'Neill's clinical decision‐making model could be tested by educators and experienced nurses to assess the efficacy of this hybrid approach to decision making.",

		"abstract": "Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia can be treated with intensive chemotherapy, low-intensity therapy such as low-dose aracytine or hypomethylating agents, or best supportive care. The choice between these treatments is a function of many patient-related and disease-related factors. We investigated how physicians' behavioral characteristics affect medical decision-making between intensive and non-intensive therapy in this setting. A nationwide cross-sectional online survey of hematologists collected data on medical decision-making for 6 clinical vignettes involving older acute myeloid leukemia patients that were representative of routine practice. Questionnaires elicited physicians' demographic and occupational characteristics along with their individual behavioral characteristics according to a decision theory framework. From the pattern of responses to the vignettes, a K-means clustering algorithm was used to distinguish those who were likely to prescribe more intensive therapy and those who were likely to prescribe less intensive or no therapy. Multivariate analyses were used to identify physician's characteristics predictive of medical decision-making. We obtained 230 assessable answers, which represented an adjusted response rate of 45.4%. A multivariate model (n=210) revealed that physicians averse to uncertainty recommend significantly more intensive chemotherapy: Odds Ratio (OR) [95% Confidence Interval (CI)]: 1.15 [1.01;1.30]; P=0.039. Male physicians who do not conform to the expected utility model (assumed as economically irrational) recommend more intensive chemotherapy [OR (95% CI) = 3.45 (1.34; 8.85); P=0.01]. Patient volume per physician also correlated with therapy intensity [OR (95% CI)=0.98 (0.96; 0.99); P=0.032]. The physicians' medical decision-making was not affected by their age, years of experience, or hospital facility. The significant association between medical decision and individual behavioral characteristics of the physician identifies a novel non-biological factor that may affect acute myeloid leukemia patients' outcomes and explain variations in clinical practice. It should also encourage the use of validated predictive models and the description of novel bio-markers to best select patients for intensive chemotherapy or low-intensity therapy.",

		"abstract": "The utility of diagnostic tests derives from the ability to translate the population concepts of sensitivity and specificity into information that will be useful for the individual patient: the predictive value of the result. As the array of available diagnostic testing broadens, there is a temptation to de-emphasize history and physical findings and defer to the objective rigor of technology. However, diagnostic test interpretation is not always straightforward. One significant barrier to routine use of probability-based test interpretation is the uncertainty inherent in pretest probability estimation, the critical first step of Bayesian reasoning. The context in which this uncertainty presents the greatest challenge is when test results oppose clinical judgment. It is this situation when decision support would be most helpful. The authors propose a simple graphical approach that incorporates uncertainty in pretest probability and has specific application to the interpretation of unexpected results. This method quantitatively demonstrates how uncertainty in disease probability may be amplified when test results are unexpected (opposing clinical judgment), even for tests with high sensitivity and specificity. The authors provide a simple nomogram for determining whether an unexpected test result suggests that one should ``switch diagnostic sides.'' This graphical framework overcomes the limitation of pretest probability uncertainty in Bayesian analysis and guides decision making when it is most challenging: interpretation of unexpected test results.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\n              The practice of medicine is rarely straightforward. Data used to facilitate medical decision making may be conflicting, ambiguous, or scarce, and providing optimal care requires balancing clinicians’ expertise and available evidence with patients’ preferences. To explore uncertainty in decision making across disciplines, the authors performed a scoping review and thematic analysis of the literature to formulate a model describing the decision-making process in medicine under uncertain conditions.\n            \n            \n              Method\n              In 2016, the authors performed a comprehensive search of key databases using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary. They identified and reviewed 3,398 records. After applying their inclusion and exclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts and then full texts, 19 articles were selected. The authors applied a qualitative thematic analysis to these articles, using codes to extract themes related to uncertainty in decision making.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The 19 articles spanned 6 fields of study and 5 disciplines within the health sciences. The thematic analysis revealed 6 main themes: recognition of uncertainty, classification of uncertainty, stakeholder perspectives, knowledge acquisition, decision-making approach, and evaluation of the decision-making process.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Based on the themes that emerged from their thematic analysis of the literature characterizing the effects of uncertainty and ambiguity on the decision-making process, the authors developed a framework depicting the interplay between these themes with a visual representation of the decision-making process under uncertain conditions. Future research includes further development and validation of this framework to inform medical school curricula.",

Recent trends in use of ICUs, life‐sustaining treatments (LSTs), and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) during EOL hospitalizations among older adults with advanced cancer and patterns of in‐hospital death are unknown.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We used SEER‐Medicare data (2003–2017) to identify beneficiaries with advanced solid cancer (summary stage 7) who died within 3 years of diagnosis. We identified EOL hospitalizations (within 30 days of death), classifying them by increasing intensity of care into: (1) without ICU; (2) with ICU but without LST (invasive mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, acute dialysis) or NIV; (3) with ICU and NIV but without LST; and (4) with ICU and LST use. We constructed a multinomial regression model to evaluate trends in risk‐adjusted hospitalization, overall and across hospitalization categories, adjusting for sociodemographics, cancer characteristics, comorbidities, and frailty. We evaluated trends in in‐hospital death across categories.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of 226,263 Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer, 138,305 (61.1%) were hospitalized at EOL [Age, Mean (SD):77.9(7.1) years; 45.5% female]. Overall, EOL hospitalizations remained high throughout, from 78.1% (95% CI: 77.4, 78.7) in 2004 to 75.5% (95% CI: 74.5, 76.2) in 2017. Hospitalizations without ICU use decreased from 49.3% (95% CI: 48.5, 50.2) to 35.0% (95% CI: 34.2, 35.9) while hospitalizations with more intensive care increased, from 23.7% (95% CI: 23.0, 24.4) to 28.7% (95% CI: 27.9, 29.5) for ICU without LST or NIV, 0.8% (95% CI: 0.6, 0.9) to 3.8% (95% CI: 3.4, 4.1) for ICU with NIV but without LST, and 4.3% (95% CI: 4.0, 4.7) to 8.0% (95% CI: 7.5, 8.5) for ICU with LST use. Among those who experienced in‐hospital death, the proportion receiving ICU care increased from 46.5% to 65.0%.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Among older adults with advanced cancer, EOL hospitalization rates remained stable from 2004–2017. However, intensity of care during EOL hospitalizations increased as evidenced by increasing use of ICUs, LSTs, and NIV.",

		"abstract": "Whether the higher rates of mental hospitalization and involuntary treatment for marginal social groups are due to differential labeling or simply to the occurrence of higher rates of disorder in these groups remains unresolved. I reexamine this issue with data from the National Comorbidity Survey (N = 5,877) that allow comparisons between disturbed individuals living in the community untreated and disturbed persons who have been hospitalized or seen a professional for their mental health problems under pressure or voluntarily. Contrary to labeling theory, members of lower status groups are not consistently overrepresented among those who have been hospitalized or seen a professional against their will. Consistent with self-labeling theory, persons with greater education and those not in poverty are disproportionately present among individuals who sought treatment by choice. Additional analyses show that factors that predict service utilization are important determinants of mental health service use but do not account systematically for status disparities in hospital or outpatient treatment, especially disparities by poverty status. Although I do not confirm a central tenet of labeling theory here, the negative consequences of labeling and stigma continue to be well-supported in the literature.",

		"abstract": "How does health insurance affect health? After reviewing the evidence on this question, we reach three conclusions. First, many of the studies claiming to show a causal effect of health insurance on health do not do so convincingly because the observed correlation between insurance and good health may be driven by other, unobservable factors. Second, convincing evidence demonstrates that health insurance can improve health measures of some population subgroups, some of which, although not all, are the same subgroups that would be the likely targets of coverage expansion policies. Third, for policy purposes we need to know whether the results of these studies generalize. Solid answers to the multitude of important questions about how specific health insurance policy options may affect health seem likely to be forthcoming only with investment of substantial resources in social experiments.",
